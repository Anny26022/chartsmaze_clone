This move aligns with international markets like the UK and US where lower karat jewellery is common. The change is expected to boost diamond and studded jewellery sales, particularly for everyday wear and gifts under \u20b920,000-\u20b930,000, targeting younger and budget-conscious consumers. Sen clarified that 9-karat jewellery is intended for diamond and fashion buyers, not gold investors, while 22-karat remains standard for traditional and wedding jewellery. He noted that while making charges may appear similar in absolute terms across different karat levels, the lower gold content makes 9-karat pieces more accessible. The industry awaits clarity on new BIS regulations regarding 24-karat coin manufacturing by authorized mints and refineries.",
