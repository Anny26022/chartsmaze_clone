Pallab Banerjee, Managing Director of Pearl Global Industries, warns that India's $6 billion apparel exports could drop to 10-15% if tariffs remain for three to six months. US brands are demanding Indian exporters either absorb costs by reducing selling prices by 16% or shift manufacturing to other countries. Pearl Global Industries, with manufacturing operations in Bangladesh, Vietnam, Indonesia and Guatemala, can relocate production, but companies without such flexibility will lose business. The company has 50% exposure to the US market, with India representing 25% of total revenue, putting 12.5% of total revenue at risk. The timing impacts new order bookings for spring and summer products. India faces a 25-30% additional tariff disadvantage compared to competing countries like Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Vietnam.

He explained that tariffs on cotton garments from India, Indonesia, and Vietnam typically range from 12-19%, with synthetics at 26%. A previous 10% baseline tariff appears set to be replaced by a 25% tariff. Updated tariffs for Indonesia and Vietnam have been declared at 19% and 20% respectively. Banerjee noted the timing is challenging as spring-summer orders for Western countries are currently being booked, with some customers delaying orders from late July to early August.
