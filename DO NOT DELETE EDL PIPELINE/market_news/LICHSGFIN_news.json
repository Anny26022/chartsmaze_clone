While banks quickly repriced loans following repo rate reductions, LIC Housing Finance's prime lending rate is not repo-linked, requiring board decisions for adjustments. The company cut lending rates by 25 basis points in April, but this wasn't sufficient to prevent outflows that reduced expected loan growth by 1.5%. Shares closed at Rs 572, down 3.61%.",
