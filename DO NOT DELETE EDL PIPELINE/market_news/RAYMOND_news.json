The FTA will help Indian exporters compete equally with Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Indonesia, which already have zero-duty benefits. Agarwal noted that thin textile margins and high duties previously limited exports to high-value products only. Raymond expects to benefit from its integrated supply chain and lead time advantages. The company anticipates its UK export revenue to double over the next 18-24 months. Agarwal views this agreement as opening doors for future EU negotiations and strengthening export capabilities.",
