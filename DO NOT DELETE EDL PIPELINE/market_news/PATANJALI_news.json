The court reserved its verdict on an interim injunction application in a disparaging ads case filed by Dabur against Patanjali. Dabur alleges that Patanjali's advertisement falsely claims its chyawanprash contains '51 Ayurvedic herbs and saffron' despite a 2014 government advisory deeming such claims misleading. Dabur also contends that Patanjali's use of 'Special' as a prefix violates Drug Rules regarding misleading labelling of Ayurvedic formulations. Patanjali's legal team defended the advertisement as permissible puffery and hyperbole, arguing they are allowed to claim superiority over competitors.",
