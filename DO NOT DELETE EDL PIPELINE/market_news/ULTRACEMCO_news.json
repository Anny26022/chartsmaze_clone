The company crossed Rs 75,000 crore revenue in fiscal 2025 and is approaching 200 MTPA capacity. UltraTech recently acquired India Cements and Kesoram Industries' cement business, adding 26.3 MTPA grey cement capacity, and plans organic capacity addition of 28.8 MTPA by fiscal 2027. The net debt to Ebitda ratio rose to 1.33x in March 2025, but management anticipates reduction through higher volume growth and improving margins. Cement demand moderated to 4-5% in fiscal 2024-25 due to temporary slowdown in government infrastructure spending and prolonged monsoon, but is expected to rebound to 6-7% in fiscal 2025-26. The company added 42.6 MTPA consolidated grey cement capacity in fiscal 2025, reaching total capacity of 188.8 MTPA. India Cements achieved Ebitda break-even in March 2025 quarter after efficiency improvements. UltraTech faces competition from Ambuja Cements, which crossed 100 MTPA capacity and aims to reach 118 MTPA by FY2026.",
