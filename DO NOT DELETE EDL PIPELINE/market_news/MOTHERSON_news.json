            "Summary": "Samvardhana Motherson International shares are in focus after Volkswagen AG, its largest client contributing 9% of revenue in financial year 2025, warned of potential production stoppages due to supply chain issues. The disruption stems from a dispute over Chinese-owned chipmaker Nexperia, which has created semiconductor supply constraints for European automakers after the Dutch government seized control citing security concerns and Beijing restricted chip exports in response. Volkswagen indicated production hasn't been affected yet but cautioned disruptions could occur short-term. Additionally, BMW, another major client accounting for 5% of Samvardhana Motherson's revenue, issued a profit warning reducing its automotive EBIT margin guidance to 5-6% from 5-7% and cutting free cash flow projections from over \u20ac5 billion to over \u20ac2.5 billion due to weak Chinese sales and higher costs. Samvardhana Motherson has implemented a mandate ensuring no single client exceeds 10% of total revenue as part of its five-year plan.

            "Summary": "Samvardhana Motherson International Ltd shares declined nearly 2% following a profit warning from BMW, which accounts for approximately 5% of the company's revenue. BMW reduced its volume expectations for the Chinese market and lowered its automotive EBIT margin guidance to 5-6% from the previous 5-7% target. The automaker also cut its automotive free cash flow projection from above \u20ac5 billion to above \u20ac2.5 billion. These revisions stem from weak sales in China, higher tariff costs, and dealer support payments due to reduced commissions on local financial products. BMW postponed expected customs duty reimbursements totaling a high three-digit million figure from 2025 to the following year. Western automakers including BMW, Audi, and Porsche face intensifying competition from local Chinese EV manufacturers like BYD and Xiaomi, resulting in declining unit sales. BMW expects its next-generation EVs, including the newly launched iX3 SUV from its Neue Klasse line, to support future sales.",
