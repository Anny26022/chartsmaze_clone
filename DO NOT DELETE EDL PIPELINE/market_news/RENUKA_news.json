            "Summary": "The government maintained ethanol prices from sugar-based feedstocks at Rs 65.61 per litre for Ethanol Supply Year 2025-26, disappointing sugar companies who sought price parity with maize-based ethanol at Rs 66.07 per litre. Shree Renuka Sugars' Executive Chairman Atul Chaturvedi called the decision a major dampener, noting the industry had invested Rs 35,000-40,000 crore in ethanol capacity based on government incentives. While rice-based ethanol prices increased 3% to Rs 60.32 per litre, sugar mills received no relief despite higher Fair and Remunerative Prices for cane. Price realization from ethanol stands at Rs 37 per kg, below domestic sugar prices of Rs 39-41 per kg across states. The pricing structure may push mills to produce more sugar and less ethanol, potentially creating supply surplus and depressing sugar values with the expected large harvest in late October.",
