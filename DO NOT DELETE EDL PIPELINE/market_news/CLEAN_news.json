The revenue decline was primarily driven by lower sales in established products, with top four products contributing 80% to standalone revenue versus 84% in the previous quarter. EBITDA margins remained resilient at 44% despite the revenue moderation. Standalone EBITDA was INR 90 crores (down 10% quarter-on-quarter) and PAT was INR 65 crores (down 15% quarter-on-quarter). The company attributed lower sales to customers experiencing sharp price declines in their end products due to competitive pressure from Chinese suppliers, leading to slower procurement. Additionally, demand uncertainty in end markets prompted some customers to defer procurement plans. The HALS segment showed positive momentum with monthly run-rate volumes averaging 260 tons per month, representing over 25% growth compared to the previous quarter. Material margins for HALS portfolio improved to 35% from 31%. The company commercialized HALS 2020 and barbituric acid during the quarter. Performance Chemical 1 is undergoing chemical trials with satisfactory results, and commercialization is expected this month. The facility has an installed capacity of about 10,000 tons with potential revenue of INR 300 crores at current prices over a 3-year period by FY28.",

Avendus Capital's unit accidentally executed duplicate trades while attempting to sell 24% of Clean Science shares worth $300 million, believing their initial transaction hadn't gone through. The incident occurred because the trades were conducted during regular market hours rather than in India's dedicated 15-minute block deal windows, which only allow discounts up to 1%. The Clean Science shares were offered at a 13% discount, exceeding the block deal limit. In response, India's Securities and Exchange Board proposed changes including tripling the discount limit to 3% and raising minimum trade sizes to 250 million rupees from 100 million rupees. Block deals have become increasingly popular in India, overtaking IPOs as a preferred method for large investors to reduce holdings. Market experts suggest that large block deals relative to company size should be conducted in separate block windows to prevent similar incidents.",
