            "Summary": "Alicon Castalloy Limited reported revenues of Rs. 429 crore for Q2 FY26, marking the third consecutive quarter of sequential growth despite a 7.7% year-on-year decline. The company achieved gross margins of 48.9%, an improvement of 300 basis points quarter-on-quarter, and EBITDA margins of 12.9%.

Revenue mix showed 2-wheelers contributing 44%, passenger vehicles 41%, commercial vehicles 10%, and non-auto 5%.
