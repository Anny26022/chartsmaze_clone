Chairman Gautam Chand Jain highlighted that the business environment remains challenging due to uncertainty around US tariff announcements, which has constrained demand and disrupted the value chain. US customers are deferring large-scale home improvement projects in favor of lower-cost options. India now faces a 25% tariff in the US market, effective from shipments after August 7th, compared to the previous 10% rate. The company is focusing on diversifying its geographic presence, with encouraging demand from non-US markets including Czech Republic, Canada, France, Mexico, and Russia. Pokarna plans to open an Experience Center in Hyderabad within 6 months to strengthen brand visibility. The company expects its KREOS product line to begin contributing this fiscal year, with initial contributions from the Chromia line also anticipated. New expansion capacity is expected to add approximately Rs. 500 crore in additional turnover when fully operational, with production starting in financial year 2026-27. The company maintains it will revisit pricing structures with customers based on the tariff situation while continuing to focus on product innovation and customer retention.",
