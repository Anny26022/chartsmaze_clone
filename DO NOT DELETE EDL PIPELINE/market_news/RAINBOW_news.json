The company posted a strong EBITDA margin of 29.4% in Q1 FY26 but will not revise its full-year guidance upward. Chairman and Managing Director Dr. Ramesh Kancharla indicated that margins may face pressure as three new hospitals with approximately 250 beds become operational this year. The company expects pre-Ind AS margins of 24-25% and post-Ind AS margins of 29-30% for FY26. Average revenue per patient is projected to grow 6% year-on-year, consistent with earlier projections. The rise in average revenue per occupied bed has been driven by stronger case mix including pediatric surgical, specialty, and quaternary care services like cardiac transplants and neurosurgeries. Surgical revenues demonstrated strong momentum with at least 15% growth in both volume and value. However, overall hospital occupancy declined to around 40% due to seasonal slowdown in outpatient and pediatric intensive care segments.",
