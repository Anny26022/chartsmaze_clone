            "Summary": "Hindustan Petroleum Corp. (HPCL) Chairman Vikas Kaushal stated that potential US secondary sanctions deterring Russian crude purchases would not significantly impact the company's earnings. Russian crude represented only 13% of HPCL's refining portfolio in the April-June quarter, down from the previous year due to economic rather than geopolitical reasons. The US imposed 25% tariffs on India for buying Russian crude, effective August 27, adding to previously announced 25% tariffs. HPCL has received no government guidance to avoid Russian oil and remains free to make economically-driven purchasing decisions. The company used Russian oil primarily at its Visakhapatnam refinery but found other crude sources more attractive. An analyst noted that Indian refiners could lose $1 per barrel in gross refining margins, but HPCL would be least impacted due to its minimal refining portfolio compared to marketing volume.",
