The potential $4.5 billion transaction is being reviewed alongside alternative options including an IPO and share swap with minority investors. Biocon is restructuring its wholly owned subsidiary to unlock shareholder value and reduce acquisition-related debt of $1.2 billion from the 2022 acquisition of Viatris' global biosimilars business for $3.3 billion. Chairperson Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw confirmed the company is exploring all value creation routes and has appointed Morgan Stanley to identify the best alternative. Biocon owns a 90.2% stake in Biocon Biologics, with Serum Institute of Life Sciences holding 5.97%. The IPO route has been deprioritized due to market volatility, with the board now examining a merger as a more viable alternative.",

The reaffirmation considers Biocon's diversified business model across biosimilars, generics, and research services, with vertical integration and global footprint.

Biocon Biologics Limited (BBL), the largest revenue contributor, has received approval for 11 biosimilars across regulated and emerging markets and plans to launch five more biosimilars. The company reported 10.6% revenue growth in the latest results, with operating profit margin improving to 26.8% from 22.6% in the previous year, partly due to a one-time gain of Rs. 1,057 crores from selling its branded formulations segment to Eris Lifesciences. BBL refinanced borrowings through senior secured notes worth $800 million and a syndicated term loan of $320 million. Biocon raised Rs. 4,500 crores through equity via Qualified Institutional Placement in June, which was used to retire structured debt and improve leverage metrics.
