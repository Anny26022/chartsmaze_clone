Executive Director Kirat Patel attributed the subdued performance to US government actions impacting the company in four ways: direct US exports affected, customer demand reduced due to their US export challenges, increased Chinese competition in domestic markets, and sanctions on some Indian distributors in their supply chain. The methylamines segment was more impacted than ethylamines, with overall market facing capacity overhang as fourth player Aarti Drugs commissioned its plant. The company expects mechanical completion of its new Rs. 120 crore project in Kurkumbh by February-March 2026, targeting dyes, pigments and electronics markets. Anti-dumping duties on acetonitrile implemented in June are expected to show benefits from Q4 onwards, though Chinese competitors remain aggressive on pricing. Management anticipates the current subdued demand conditions may continue due to ongoing geopolitical uncertainties.",
