Key financial metrics show OneSource with the largest turnover at INR 12,995.89 million and net worth of INR 59,108.37 million.

Post-merger, OneSource's promoter shareholding will increase from 29.77% to 36.17%. The scheme requires approvals from shareholders, creditors, stock exchanges, SEBI, National Company Law Tribunal, Singapore High Court, and other regulatory authorities. The consolidation aims to strengthen business capabilities, create operational synergies, and enhance shareholder value in the contract development and manufacturing operations sector.",
