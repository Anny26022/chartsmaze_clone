            "Summary": "ICICI Lombard General Insurance clarified that its 'Material Change' clause in health insurance policies will not result in higher premiums or coverage changes if policyholders develop new illnesses after purchasing the policy. The clarification addresses concerns raised on social media and by consumer groups regarding the clause's interpretation in plans like Elevate and Health AdvantEdge. The insurer stated the clause is designed to recognize positive health changes that could lead to lower premiums or wellness benefits. The company emphasized it follows IRDAI rules and industry standards, noting that the clause works with renewal terms without requiring fresh medical tests or underwriting at renewal, except when policyholders request to increase sum insured, add members, or include additional covers. ICICI Lombard reported no claims have been rejected due to this clause. The clause requires customers to disclose new illnesses at renewal, but such disclosures will not affect premiums or coverage unless changes are requested by the policyholder.",
