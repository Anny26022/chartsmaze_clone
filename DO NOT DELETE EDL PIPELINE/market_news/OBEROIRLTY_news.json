            "Title": "Oberoi Realty Q1 Results: Profit Falls 28% Despite Strong Pre-Sales, Brokerages Maintain Buy Ratings",
            "Summary": "Oberoi Realty reported quarterly results showing a 28% decline in profit to Rs 421 crore and a 30% drop in revenue to Rs 988 crore compared to the same period last year. EBITDA fell 36.2% to Rs 520 crore with margins contracting to 52.7%. Despite the decline in financial metrics, the company demonstrated robust sales across most projects and steady free cash flow. Strong pre-sales were driven by new launches at Elysian, Gurgaon, and the company maintained a comfortable net debt to equity ratio of 0.12x. The annuity business showed strength with steady occupancy rates. However, the company faced challenges with slower collections and development margins declining to 45%. Both JPMorgan and Nomura maintained positive ratings with 'overweight' and 'buy' calls respectively, both setting target prices of Rs 2,000. Nomura attributed the revenue and EBITDA decline to no revenue recognition from the 360West project, expecting pre-sales from this project to be visible in upcoming quarters.",
