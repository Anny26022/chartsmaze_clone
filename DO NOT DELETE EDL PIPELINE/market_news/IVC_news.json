The company's board determined the delay was beyond their control as APUIAML couldn't convene board meetings due to unavailability of government-nominated directors, and has since completed and submitted the delayed results while requesting waiver of penalties.",

The company generated no revenue from operations during the quarter, with total revenue of \u20b9144.67 lakhs coming entirely from other income including fair value gains on investments. The company could not adopt consolidated results as subsidiaries Andhra Pradesh Urban Infrastructure Asset Management Limited and IL&FS Investment Advisors LLC failed to provide their limited review results.
