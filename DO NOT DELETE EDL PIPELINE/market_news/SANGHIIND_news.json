The deployment is expected to directly reduce 60,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually with potential to increase 10x in due course. The technology will provide clean heat to dry and enhance alternative fuels, enabling higher substitution of fossil fuels. This supports Adani Cement's goals to increase alternative fuel ratio to 30% and achieve 60% green power share by FY28, while advancing their net-zero targets by 2050. The companies plan to launch at least five additional projects within the next two years.
