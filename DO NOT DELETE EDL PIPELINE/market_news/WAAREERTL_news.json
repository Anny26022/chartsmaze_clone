            "Summary": "Waaree Renewable Technologies shares fell 6.2% to Rs 1,112.35 following reports that US solar panel manufacturers petitioned the Commerce Department to impose tariffs on imports from India, Indonesia, and Laos. The Alliance for American Solar Manufacturing and Trade accused manufacturers in these countries of dumping products below cost and receiving unfair government subsidies. The petition targets Chinese-owned firms shifting production and Indian manufacturers directly. Imports from the three countries rose to $1.6 billion in 2024 from $289 million in 2022. The Commerce Department has 20 days to decide on launching a formal investigation. Despite the stock decline, Waaree reported strong quarterly results with net profit jumping 205% to Rs 86.44 crore and revenue more than doubling to Rs 603.18 crore. The company's shares remain down 20.3% year-to-date despite recent monthly gains.",
