Chairman Venkateswarlu Jasti emphasized the binary nature of drug discovery, noting the 10-15 year development timeline and uncertain outcomes. The company completed a Rs 857 crore fundraising round, split equally between Jasti's family and external investors. Jasti acknowledged limited investor interest in pure drug discovery in India and stated no profitability is expected until a molecule succeeds, as the company currently has no revenue. The market opportunity for successful treatment could reach multibillion-dollar potential. Other pipeline molecules SUVN-G3031 and SUVN-911 are also expected to produce results around 2027.
