The probe involves loans totaling Rs 12,524 crore extended by RHFL and RCFL, with the majority disbursed to firms linked to the Reliance Anil Ambani Group. Of these loans, Rs 6,931 crore have been declared non-performing assets. Preliminary findings indicate funds were routed back to other Reliance group companies, suggesting circular lending practices. Yes Bank's Rana Kapoor played a key role in sanctioning these loans, with his family-linked firms also receiving credit facilities. A Grant Thornton audit has identified significant fund diversion and lending policy violations. The ED has conducted searches across 60 companies and 22 individuals. State Bank of India has declared Reliance Communications and Anil Ambani's account as fraud, filing a CBI complaint.
