The company increased focus on CPVC pipes (currently 15% of volume) through a tie-up with Lubrizol for TempRite brand, targeting 25% mix over next 2-3 years. Apollo incurred capex of INR 92 crores in H1 following INR 166 crores in FY25, remaining committed to expanding total installed capacity to 286,000 tons over next 2 years without debt. The West India facility acquired last year is seeing steady production ramp-up, while the new Varanasi plant is expected to commence operations soon. Management expects more favorable demand environment from November onwards post-monsoon, with increased government infrastructure spending anticipated to boost liquidity. The company maintains guidance of achieving around 100,000 tons sales volume for the full year, hoping for macro turnaround support.",
