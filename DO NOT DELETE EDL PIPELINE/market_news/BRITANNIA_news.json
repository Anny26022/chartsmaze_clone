Bloomberg estimates project 8% revenue growth to Rs 4,610.9 crore and 13% net profit increase to Rs 569 crore. Analysts expect growth driven by 5-6% pricing increases and volume expansion of 3-5.5%. However, EBITDA margins may compress from 18.2% to 17.7% due to elevated raw material costs. Brokerage ratings remain mixed - JM Financial maintains 'Buy' with Rs 5,960 target calling it a top pick, Jefferies holds 'Hold' at Rs 5,768.9, while HSBC has 'Reduce' rating with Rs 5,030 target. Key growth drivers include biscuit volume growth of 3%, price hikes of 6%, and grammage cuts, though gross margins are expected to contract due to commodity price inflation.",
