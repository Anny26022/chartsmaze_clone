The weakness is attributed to volume declines of 11-12% to 1.37 million units, driven by production challenges in April and continued demand weakness in the entry-level 110cc motorcycle segment. While realizations are expected to rise 7-10% due to richer product mix, price hikes, and higher contribution from spare parts and exports, this is unlikely to offset the volume impact. Brokerages forecast EBITDA margin contractions ranging from 26-60 basis points, with margins expected between 13.8-14.1%. The pressure comes from weak ICE sales, higher EV contribution, product launch expenses, and lower operational scale. Key focus areas include management commentary on rural and entry-level segment demand outlook and updates on the company's EV roadmap.",
