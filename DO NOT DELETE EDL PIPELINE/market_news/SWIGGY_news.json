            "Summary": "India's food delivery market has matured with growth normalizing to 17-18% GMV from earlier 25%, according to Karan Taurani of Elara Capital. Revenue and EBITDA growth are converging with margins stabilizing around 25-28% from previous 40%+ CAGR levels. Swiggy and Zomato continue their market dominance with no major new entrants challenging their duopoly. Quick commerce expansion and aggressive capital burn are pushing profitability for both companies beyond FY27. Taurani believes Eternal and Blinkit have struck a better balance in growth versus losses. Swiggy's Q1 FY27 breakeven guidance appears achievable from contribution margin perspective, with stock expected to remain range-bound between \u20b9400-\u20b9470. Reliance's entry into quick commerce through dark stores and JioMart expansion is unlikely to disrupt market leaders due to scale and consumer experience challenges. In the alcoholic beverages sector, Taurani remains bullish on Radico Khaitan, citing strong innovation pipeline and high-margin premium portfolio with P&A segment contributing over 80% of revenue and growing at 20%+. United Breweries faces pressure in regular beer segment with weak volume growth, while United Spirits shows slower 12% growth.",
