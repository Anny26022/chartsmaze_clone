            "Summary": "Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders issued a clarification stating there are no ongoing negotiations with the Defence Ministry for the Rs 70,000 crore Project 75 India submarine contract. This follows conflicting reports from news agency ANI citing Defence officials claiming negotiations had begun. The Defence Ministry selected Mazagon Dock in January to build six submarines with Air Independent Propulsion systems, partnering with Germany's ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems. The companies signed an MoU in June 2023, with ThyssenKrupp handling engineering and design while Mazagon Dock manages construction. Management expects both P-75 additional submarines and P-75(I) contracts to be signed in the current financial year, potentially increasing the order book from Rs 32,000 crore to over Rs 1.25 lakh crore. The company has expanded capacity from six to 11 submarines. Shares closed 2.05% higher at Rs 2,755.70, with the stock up 24.93% over 12 months. Analyst consensus shows a price target of Rs 3,232.5, implying 17.3% upside potential.",

            "Title": "India Shifts to European Partners for $14 Billion Defence Projects Amid US Economic Pressure",
            "Summary": "India is partnering with European companies for two major defence projects worth over $14 billion, moving away from US collaboration due to aggressive economic leverage from the Trump administration. The projects include Project 75-I for six Kalvari Class submarines and the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) program, both targeting 2035 induction. Mazagon Dock And Shipbuilders Ltd. will work with German firm ThyssenKrupp for submarine Air Independent Propulsion systems, while French engine maker Safran will collaborate with DRDO's Gas Turbine Research Establishment for 120KN engines for fifth-generation aircraft. The submarine project will feature over 60% indigenous content, significantly higher than previous projects. The $7 billion engine deal with Safran includes 100% technology transfer for design, development, testing and production. These collaborations are expected to increase Mazagon Docks' order book from Rs 32,000 crore to Rs 1.25 lakh crore. India is also building two nuclear submarines under Project 77 with Russia, valued at over Rs 40,000 crore. The strategic shift aims to protect India's indigenous development programs from potential geopolitical roadblocks, particularly given past delays experienced with US technology transfers during the LCA project.",
