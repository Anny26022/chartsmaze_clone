The panel disallowed Rs 1,203 crore in tax set-offs and ordered recovery of the full tax amount with interest and penalties. HGSL had sold its healthcare division for Rs 8,000 crore, generating Rs 3,059 crore in capital gains, then merged with loss-making NxtDigital which had Rs 1,500 crore in accumulated losses. This allowed HGSL to offset losses against profits, reducing tax liability by Rs 281 crore. The panel found that internal communications revealed tax savings as the primary merger motive, with no genuine commercial substance or business synergy between the companies. The ruling represents a significant setback for the Hinduja Group and reinforces the government's strict approach to tax avoidance through corporate restructuring.",
