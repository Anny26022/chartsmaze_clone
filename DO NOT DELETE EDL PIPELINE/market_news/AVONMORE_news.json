            "Summary": "Avonmore Capital & Management Services Limited's board approved a composite scheme of arrangement involving the demerger of broking business from Almondz Global Securities Limited and multiple amalgamations with group companies. The scheme includes transferring Almondz Global's broking business (stock broking, depository participant and advisory services) to Almondz Broking Services Limited, which will retain the Almondz Global Securities name. The broking business contributed 8.65% to Almondz Global's total revenue in 2024-25. Subsequently, Almondz Global's remaining non-broking business will be amalgamated with Avonmore Capital, along with five other group companies: Almondz Insolvency Resolutions Services, Almondz Finanz, Apricot Infosoft, Avonmore Developer, and Anemone Holding. The restructuring aims to comply with Securities Contract Regulations Rules that restrict stock exchange members from engaging in non-securities businesses. Post-scheme, Avonmore Capital's promoter shareholding will decrease from 58.38% to 45.40%, while public shareholding will increase to 54.60%. The scheme requires approvals from the National Company Law Tribunal, shareholders, creditors and regulatory authorities. Listing will be sought for the new broking entity.",
