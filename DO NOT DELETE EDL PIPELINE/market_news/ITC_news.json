ITC established the Bukhara restaurant in the late 1970s, which earned \u20b948.84 crore in 2024-25. The BUKHARA trademark has been registered since 1985 and was declared a 'well-known trademark' in 2024. The court found the hotel's use of the name appeared dishonest and misleading, rejecting the defendant's claim that the name derived from the proprietor's surname 'Bukhari'. The judge noted the adoption appeared to be made with full knowledge of ITC's prior, well-known trademark status. The court has restrained the defendant from using or imitating the 'BUKHARA' mark or any deceptively similar name. The case will resume on April 14, 2026.",

            "Summary": "ITC shares climbed 3.5% to Rs 425.70 following the government's announcement of a GST restructuring that could benefit the tobacco industry. The GST Council approved simplifying the tax structure from four slabs to two main rates of 5% and 18%, while creating a new 40% category for sin goods including cigarettes. Currently, tobacco products face 28% GST plus compensation cess, but will shift to a flat 40% rate once state revenue shortfall loans are repaid. Jefferies estimates this change could reduce ITC's effective tax burden by approximately 5 percentage points, potentially allowing the industry to lower prices and compete better against illicit products. The brokerage noted this restructuring may also reduce policy uncertainty for ITC. The broader GST changes are set for September 22 implementation, though timing for tobacco-specific changes remains unclear.",

The new framework will tax tobacco products based on Retail Sale Price rather than transaction value to curb tax evasion. ITC, which generates major operating profit from cigarettes, faces continued margin pressure as tobacco products remain excluded from GST rate cuts that benefit other FMCG categories. While items like toothpaste, namkeens, cheese, and shampoos now attract 5% GST, all tobacco products including cigarettes, pan masala, and gutkha will bear the higher tax burden. Bidis will attract 28% GST plus 18% cess. The Council maintains high taxes on sin goods until compensation cess borrowings are repaid. Jefferies had expected revenue neutrality for the tobacco industry, but the developments suggest persistent margin pressure if companies cannot pass increased tax burden to consumers.",

Puri believes this GST simplification would reduce consumer costs, ease business compliance, and boost consumption. The company is investing in agriculture through resilient supply chains, digital agri-platforms, and value-added products. ITC sees favorable conditions with easing inflation, softer interest rates, and improving farm incomes.
