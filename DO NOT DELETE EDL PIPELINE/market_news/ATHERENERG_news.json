The regulations target high-energy lithium-ion batteries with energy densities of 300 Wh/kg or higher, key cathode and anode materials, and critical manufacturing machinery. Ather Energy shares gained 16% in the past month and 85% over three months, reaching Rs 634.5. The company sources lithium-ion cells from China but is reducing dependence through partnerships with Amara Raja Energy & Mobility for battery localization. Analysts view Ather's technical indicators as strong, with the stock trading above its 20-day SMA near 580-585 zone. Ola Electric shares declined 13% over the past month to Rs 52.58 and are down 41% over the past year. Despite producing 4680 lithium-ion cells at its Tamil Nadu Gigafactory and developing rare earth-free ferrite motors, Ola remains exposed to Chinese component dependencies. Technical analysts see bearish momentum for Ola Electric, recommending caution with critical support at Rs 48. Both companies face supply chain disruptions and potential cost pressures, though Ather's localization efforts and stronger technical position may provide better near-term resilience.",

Speaking at Ather's Community Day 2025 in Bengaluru, Mehta argued that the policy shuts out startups like Ather from applying despite their role in electric mobility disruption. He stated that Ather has invested heavily in EV R&D and built large infrastructure but doesn't qualify for PLI benefits. Mehta claimed the framework favors larger incumbents who may lack serious EV commitments and called for policy corrections. He noted that PLI access could enable Ather to launch lower-priced products and compete in the mass-market segment. Ather has doubled its market share to nearly 17% in August and leads the EV market across South India and Gujarat. The company unveiled its new EL platform at the event.",
