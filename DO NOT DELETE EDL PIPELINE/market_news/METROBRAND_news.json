The GST cut will make the Rs 2,500-2,700 price point redundant, as retailers will prefer selling at Rs 2,499 to capture GST benefits. Around 44% of Metro Brands' sales come from products under Rs 3,000, with 40% below Rs 2,500. Joseph expects the price reduction to spur demand and support the company's growth trajectory.
