            "Summary": "Spectrum Electrical Industries Limited has announced a delay in utilizing funds raised through its Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) conducted during financial year 2023-24. The company raised Rs. 36.55 crores through the QIP, with Rs. 22.14 crores allocated for working capital requirements and Rs. 14.41 crores for general corporate purposes. As of June 30, 2025, Rs. 27.59 crores has been utilized, leaving Rs. 8.95 crores pending utilization. The delay stems from an extended approval process with the Town Planning Department for construction of a factory building with 2,64,548 square feet built-up area. Confusion at the departmental level regarding permissions for projects exceeding 2 lakh square feet led to multiple clarifications and reviews, causing an 8-10 month delay in obtaining final building plan approval. The company has now received all requisite approvals and construction work is underway. Unutilized funds are temporarily invested in fixed deposits with scheduled commercial banks.",
