            "Summary": "Ola Electric refuted allegations of stealing battery technology from South Korea's LG Energy Solution, calling the reports misleading and baseless. The company stated that the alleged leaked pouch cell technology is not part of its research focus, as Ola Electric's 4680 Bharat Cell uses advanced dry electrode technology in cylindrical form. Reports from South Korea claimed a former LG Energy Solution executive attempted to pass pouch cell technology to Ola Electric. Ola Electric questioned the timing of these allegations, coinciding with its 4680 Bharat Cell entering commercial production. The company asserted that fear of losing market opportunities is driving the foreign rival to attack indigenous battery innovation. Ola Electric highlighted its 720 patent filings with 124 granted patents and established India's first operational Gigafactory with Rs 2,500 crore investment. The company positioned its 4680 Bharat Cell as India's first indigenous large-format cell competing directly with Korean manufacturers in the domestic market.",

            "Summary": "LG Energy Solution has accused Ola Electric of accessing confidential battery technology through a former researcher who allegedly leaked proprietary information about pouch-type ternary lithium-ion battery manufacturing processes. The ex-researcher is under investigation by South Korean authorities and has admitted to transferring information to Ola Electric but denies knowing it was confidential. This adds to Ola Electric's legal challenges, following a previous dispute with MapmyIndia over license agreement violations. Despite being India's top patent filer with 205 patents and launching its own lithium-ion cell production, industry experts question the originality of Ola's technology development, suggesting the company may have copied designs rather than developing them independently.",
