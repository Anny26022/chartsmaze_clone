The company faced challenges from rising gold prices affecting buyer growth, with overall buyer growth at minus 2% for the quarter, while gold jewelry buyers declined 11% and studded jewelry buyers grew 3%. Gold coins showed exceptional growth driven by strong investment demand. The company launched powerful gold exchange campaigns and introduced lower carat offerings including 18-carat jewelry to stimulate demand. Titan expanded 35 stores in the first half and renovated close to 35 existing stores. International operations, particularly North America, continued strong performance.

            "Summary": "Titan Company is expected to report strong quarterly results with net profit projected to jump 38% year-on-year, aided by a low base effect from customs duty adjustments in the previous year. Revenue is forecast to grow around 10% YoY according to six brokerages. However, the jewellery business, which contributes 88% of overall revenue, is expected to see moderated sequential growth due to higher gold prices and delayed festive purchases. Brokerages project consolidated revenue growth of 10-13% YoY, with standalone jewellery sales excluding bullion rising 12-14%. The watches and eyewear divisions are expected to post double-digit growth. Gold prices surged 18% between August and September, likely postponing some festive-season purchases. Jewellery EBIT margins are projected to be around 11-11.5%, slightly lower than last year due to elevated gold prices. The studded jewellery segment is expected to show first signs of recovery after four quarters of decline, with its share staying flat at around 30%. CaratLane revenue is projected to climb 25% YoY with flat margins of 7%.",
