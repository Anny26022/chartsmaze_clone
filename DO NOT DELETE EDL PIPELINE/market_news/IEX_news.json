The tribunal previously asked IEX to file a revised plea adding new respondents including Grid Corporation of India, Power Exchange of India, and Hindustan Power Exchange. IEX shares had declined 30% in July after the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission approved market coupling implementation for the Day Ahead Market, scheduled for January 2026. Under the new system, different power exchanges will operate as market coupling operators on a round-robin basis, with a Market Coupler collecting and matching buy-sell orders to discover uniform pricing across all exchanges.

            "Summary": "SEBI investigated a major insider trading case involving Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) shares where eight individuals illegally profited Rs 173 crore. The traders purchased put options on IEX just before the stock crashed nearly 30%, with none having prior trading history in the company. Bhoovan Singh led the group with over Rs 72 crore in gains. The scheme involved leaked confidential information from Central Electricity Regulatory Commission meetings regarding market coupling policy decisions in July. SEBI traced the leak to two CERC officials, with evidence showing Bhoovan Singh had access to internal CERC documents and searched online for ways to profit from insider information. Sanjeev Kumar visited CERC headquarters eight days before the policy announcement and photographed himself watching a confidential board meeting, sharing it in a WhatsApp group. When NSE flagged the suspicious trades, message histories were deleted but backup evidence remained, leading to SEBI barring all eight individuals.",

            "Summary": "SEBI has barred eight individuals from capital markets with immediate effect for alleged insider trading in Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) shares, resulting in illegal gains exceeding Rs 173 crore. The individuals named are Bhoovan Singh, Amar Jit Singh Soran, Amita Soran, Anita, Narender Kumar, Virender Singh, Bindu Sharma and Sanjeev Kumar. The action follows SEBI's examination of suspicious trading activity around CERC's market coupling directive announced on July 23, 2025. IEX shares fell over 29% on July 24 following the announcement. PUT European options expiring July 31 surged to 65,212 on July 22, before the CERC order became public. SEBI found the trading was executed in a coordinated manner using unpublished price sensitive information, creating market imbalance and disadvantaging other investors. The interim order remains effective until further notice.",
