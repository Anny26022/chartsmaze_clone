Net profit is expected to rise marginally by 0.6% to Rs 751 crore. Analysts cite rural recovery driving gradual volume growth toward low to mid-single digits, with rural areas outpacing urban demand recovery. The company has implemented significant price hikes to counter margin pressure from high input costs including palm oil and wheat. Analyst ratings vary from Goldman Sachs' Neutral (target Rs 2,335) to Nuvama's Buy (target Rs 2,825). Key factors include declining food inflation, potential income tax cuts supporting consumption recovery, and palm oil duty cuts from 20% to 10% benefiting raw material costs. Volume growth is projected at around 3%, with price increases of approximately 3% mainly in coffee and premium chocolates.",
