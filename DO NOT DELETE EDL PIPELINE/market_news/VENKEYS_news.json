            "Summary": "Venkys India Limited held its quarterly earnings conference call discussing results for the quarter ended September 30, 2025. The company's financial performance was severely impacted by unexpected profit margin declines in the poultry segment. Sales turnover and profitability suffered due to lower realizations in day-old broiler chicks, commercial broiler birds, and broiler hatching eggs. The poor performance was attributed to festivals including Ganesh Chaturthi, Navratri, Pitrapaksh, and abnormal rains and flooding in northern regions where the company operates. Day-old broiler chick prices fell to INR 26.48 per chick compared to INR 37.22 in the previous year, representing a decline of INR 10.74 per chick. Commercial broiler bird realization dropped to INR 80.57 per kg from INR 98.50 per kg, a decrease of INR 17.93 per kg. The poultry segment reported losses of approximately INR 60 crores for the quarter. However, the Animal Health Products segment registered satisfactory performance, and the oilseeds segment continued to improve. Management indicated that prices began recovering in the last week of October and expressed optimism for better performance in the second half with the onset of winter. Raw material prices for maize and soya have declined significantly, with both trading 25% below minimum support prices.",
