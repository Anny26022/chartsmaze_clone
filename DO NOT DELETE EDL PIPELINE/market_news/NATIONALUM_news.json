The largest investment of Rs 17,000-18,000 crore will go toward expanding smelting capacity from 460,000 tonnes per year to over 960,000 tonnes. An additional 1,000 MW power plant will be established with Rs 11,000 crore investment. Nalco aims to produce over 16,000 tonnes of wire rods annually and expand rolled products capacity from 30,000 to 40,000 tonnes per year, while venturing into foil production. The company is securing raw materials through joint ventures and participating in overseas projects through Khanij Bidesh India Ltd. to secure strategic minerals like lithium and cobalt. Alumina is being procured at $370-380 through spot tenders, with average expected at $400 this year, while aluminium prices range between Rs 2,500 and Rs 5,600.",
