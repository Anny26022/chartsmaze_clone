The affirmation reflects expectations of improvement in JSW Steel's consolidated net adjusted leverage from FY26 onwards, supported by healthy domestic demand and volume ramp-up from incremental commissioned capacities at Vijayanagar and BPSL. Net leverage increased to 4.4x in FY25 due to pricing pressure from low-cost Chinese exports but improved to 3.6x in first half FY26 and is expected to sustain below 3.5x from FY26.

            "Summary": "JSW Steel is set to announce its second quarter financial results with analysts expecting mixed performance. Bloomberg estimates show revenue projected to rise 2% to Rs 44,171 crore, while profit is expected to decline 21% to Rs 1,727 crore and Ebitda to fall 8% to Rs 6,938 crore. Margins are forecast to compress to 15.71% from 17.55%. The performance reflects weaker steel price realizations offsetting gains from robust domestic demand and steady volume growth. Bank of America maintains a Buy rating with Rs 1,290 target, citing stronger domestic demand and potential policy support through higher import tariffs. Morgan Stanley expects mid-teens year-on-year growth with an Overweight rating and Rs 1,156.80 target. Jefferies projects 11% year-on-year net sales growth to Rs 43,900 crore with a Buy rating. ICICI Securities holds a more cautious view with a Hold rating and Rs 1,010 target. Key concerns include declining realizations of approximately Rs 3,000-3,500 per tonne quarter-on-quarter and higher input costs, while domestic demand strength and capacity additions provide support.",

The court rejected the committee of creditors' plea seeking an additional \u20b96,100 crore, stating such claims have no basis under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. BPSL was part of the RBI's original 'dirty dozen' referred for insolvency. In May 2025, the Supreme Court had scrapped JSW's plan citing delays and procedural violations, but reversed this decision after review petitions. JSW Steel acquired a 49% stake in BPSL through the insolvency process in 2021, later increasing it to 83% by October 2021, gaining 2.75 MTPA steel-making capacity in Odisha. The court noted that JSW had invested significantly and turned BPSL into a profitable entity. JSW Steel shares gained 1.5% following the announcement, trading 1.1% higher at \u20b91,160.5.",
