            "Summary": "Usha Financial Services has announced Monday as the last trading day for investors to purchase shares and qualify for its 1:1 bonus issue. The record date is set for August 19, with the ex-bonus date also falling on the same day. Under the 1:1 bonus structure, shareholders will receive one additional share for every existing share held as of the record date at no extra cost. For example, an investor holding 100 shares will receive 100 additional bonus shares, doubling their shareholding. The bonus issue aims to reward existing shareholders and improve stock liquidity, though the market price typically adjusts downward proportionally to reflect the increased share count while maintaining overall investment value.",
