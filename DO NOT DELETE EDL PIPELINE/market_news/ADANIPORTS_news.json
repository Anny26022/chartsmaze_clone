SEBI ruled in September that Adani Group did not violate regulatory disclosure norms or constitute market manipulation as alleged in the 2023 Hindenburg report. The group continued investing in projects with increased capital expenditure in the first half of the financial year ending March 2026. Fitch expects liquidity and funding to remain aligned with the rating, supported by cash flow from a seaports portfolio, capex flexibility, and demonstrated credit market access.
