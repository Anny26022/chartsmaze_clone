Under new CEO Rajiv Anand, the bank reported a net loss in the September quarter as loan and deposit portfolios shrank. Anand outlined a three-year turnaround plan: achieving system-level growth in financial year 2026-27, gaining market share the following year, and dominating chosen segments in the third year. The bank aims for 1% return on assets within 12-18 months, down from previous levels before the governance issues. IndusInd's stock has dropped 18% in 2025 versus an 8% rise in the Nifty 50. The bank will focus on growing its commercial vehicle financing business worth 358.80 billion rupees while reducing its microloan portfolio market share from over 10% to 6-8%. Anand stated the bank has adequate capital for the next couple of years and will explore new opportunities like wealth management and acquisition financing.",

IndusInd Bank experienced a crisis involving governance and accounting irregularities, resulting in the departures of CEO Sumant Kathpalia and deputy Khurana. Six bank officials, including Khurana, were investigated by SEBI for insider trading and were barred from securities markets while ordered to deposit alleged illegal gains totaling 197.8 million rupees. The Securities Appellate Tribunal granted partial relief to Khurana in a September 25 order, requiring him to deposit half of the alleged gains to SEBI.",

            "Summary": "IndusInd Bank is expected to report a significant drop in quarterly profit, with brokerage estimates ranging from Rs 240 crore to Rs 796 crore, representing potential year-on-year declines of up to 82%. The bank faces pressure from weak treasury income, elevated provisions from microfinance and commercial vehicle segments, and margin compression. Net Interest Income is projected to fall sharply by up to 21%, with estimates between Rs 4,200 crore and Rs 4,469 crore. Net Interest Margins are expected to contract sequentially due to sluggish loan growth and rising deposit costs. Operating profitability is anticipated to weaken due to lower treasury income and higher expenses. Loan and deposit growth are expected to remain tepid, with some brokerages projecting declines. Credit costs are likely to stay elevated around 1.9% due to continued stress in microfinance and retail portfolios. Market focus will be on commentary from the new CEO regarding the bank's growth strategy and asset quality trends.",

            "Summary": "Mumbai Police Economic Offences Wing is investigating a newly discovered \u20b9258 crore entry in the IndusInd Bank case, separate from the previously reported \u20b91,950 crore accounting mismatch in the bank's derivatives portfolio. The \u20b9258 crore figure was identified in a GT audit report covering 2015-2024, which indicates this amount was selectively used to boost the bank's net interest income during quarters when results fell short of market expectations. EOW officials stated the original \u20b91,950 crore appears to be an accounting error with no evidence of criminality found so far. The mismatch reportedly arose from different accounting methods used by the bank's Asset-Liability Management desk and treasury desk for hedging. The agency plans to re-summon former executives Sumant Kathpalia, Arun Khurana, and Gobind Jain for questioning regarding the \u20b9258 crore entry. The audit report shows senior management was aware of accounting discrepancies by 2023 but only informed the board in March 2025. EOW has ruled out fund siphoning and insider trading angles, with the focus now on determining any potential criminality linked to the \u20b9258 crore entry.",
