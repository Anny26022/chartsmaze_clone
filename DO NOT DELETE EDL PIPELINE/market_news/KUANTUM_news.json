            "Summary": "Kuantum Papers Limited reported operational income of Rs. 280 crores for Q2 FY26, marking a 25.5% sequential growth driven by higher paper production following the upgradation of paper machine 4. The company achieved its highest ever monthly production of 8,303 metric tons in September and highest daily production of 360 tons in July 2025. However, EBITDA margins contracted to 12.3% from previous quarter due to Rs. 3,200 per ton decline in net sales realization and Rs. 1,300 per ton increase in production costs, largely attributed to higher agro and wood-based raw material prices due to floods in Punjab. The company faces challenges from GST rate changes creating inverted duty structure, with paper and boards rising from 12% to 18% while converted products reduced to 5%, and notebooks made nil-rated. Management expects EBITDA margins to improve to 18-20% once capacity expansion from current 450 tons per day to 650 tons per day is completed, targeting 30-40% volume growth in FY27. The company is strategically moving away from the notebook segment and focusing on higher value-added Maplitho grades and specialty papers.",

            "Summary": "Kuantum Papers Limited reported operational income of Rs 223 crores for Q1 FY26, declining 20.6% year-on-year and 19.6% quarter-on-quarter. EBITDA fell 43.6% to Rs 40 crores with margins at 18.1%, while net profit dropped 68.3% to Rs 12 crores. The decline was primarily attributed to a planned 25-day shutdown of Paper Machine 4 for upgrades, reducing production by 9,000 tons. The company successfully completed PM4 upgrades in June 2025, adding modern equipment to boost productivity. Management noted the domestic paper industry faces challenges from high wood pricing and competitive imports, though DGTR has initiated anti-dumping investigations into paperboard imports from Indonesia. The company operates with 20% specialty papers and 80% writing and printing grades, with plans to increase specialty paper production to 30% through a new coating plant. Total CAPEX of Rs 735 crores is underway, with Rs 400 crores already spent, expected completion by June 2026. Paper prices increased marginally in Q1 but declined 7-8% in July-August due to seasonal factors.",
