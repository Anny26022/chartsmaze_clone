China controls 45% of global soda ash capacity and recently added over 10 million tonnes in Inner Mongolia, creating market surplus. The Directorate General of Trade Remedies is investigating following petitions from domestic firms. India extended minimum import price of Rs 20,108 per tonne until December 31, but GHCL's managing director R S Jalan says it provides limited benefit. Despite challenges, GHCL operates at 98% capacity utilization with 26% domestic market share. The company reported standalone net profit of Rs 145 crore on revenue of Rs 823 crore, with soda ash prices dropping 19% year-on-year while margins eroded only 5%.
