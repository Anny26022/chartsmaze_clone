However, the agency noted that near-term credit costs will remain elevated as management addresses existing problem loans, and rapid loan expansion could strain risk and control frameworks.

            "Summary": "IIFL Finance reported profit after tax of Rs.274 crores for Q1 FY26, up 9% quarter-on-quarter but down 19% year-on-year. Pre-provision operating profit increased 28% quarter-on-quarter to Rs.836 crores. Consolidated loan AUM grew 21% year-on-year to Rs.83,889 crores, driven by gold loans which surged 85% year-on-year to Rs.27,274 crores, surpassing pre-embargo levels. However, asset quality deteriorated with gross NPA at 2.3% and net NPA at 1.1%. The company faced challenges in MSME and microfinance segments, leading to higher provisioning of over Rs.500 crores. Management expects full-year credit costs around 3% compared to earlier guidance of 2.5%-2.7%. The company discontinued unsecured MSME and micro-LAP businesses due to asset quality concerns. Gold loan portfolio LTV stands at 66% with yields improving to 18.2%. Management targets overall AUM growth of around 20% for the full year while maintaining ROA guidance of 3%. The company strengthened its board with former RBI Deputy Governor B.P. Kanungo joining as a board member.",
