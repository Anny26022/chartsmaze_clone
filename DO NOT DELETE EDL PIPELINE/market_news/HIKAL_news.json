Institutional Investor Advisory Services opposes the reappointment, citing potential impact on company functioning from the ongoing ownership dispute stemming from a 1994 family arrangement. KIL, the Kalyani holding company claiming over 31% stake, defended the appointment, stating Amit has no day-to-day role and serves on no committees.
