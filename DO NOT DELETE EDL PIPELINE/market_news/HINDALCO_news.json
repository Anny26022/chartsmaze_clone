US tariffs on aluminium imports increased from 25% to 50%, which could indirectly benefit Hindalco and its subsidiary Novelis by reducing competition from other suppliers in global markets.

CFIUS subsequently requested a long-form declaration, which was submitted on September 30, 2025. The review process has been delayed due to the U.S. federal government shutdown that began on October 1, 2025, causing statutory deadlines under the CFIUS review framework to be tolled. Once the shutdown ends and CFIUS formally accepts the final filing, the review process may take up to approximately 105 days to complete.",
