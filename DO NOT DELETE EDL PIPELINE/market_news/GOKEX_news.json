Gokaldas Exports and Raymond Lifestyle are among firms planning to leverage lower African tariffs of around 10% in countries like Kenya and Ethiopia, compared to the steep US levy on Indian goods. The tariffs, which began Wednesday, are expected to reduce exports of certain goods by up to 90% and could more than halve India's overall exports to the US, its biggest market. India exported over $20 billion in textile products, jewelry and diamonds to the US in 2023. Labor-intensive sectors including jewelry and apparel face the hardest impact. African countries like Ethiopia, Nigeria, Botswana, and Morocco offer incentives including tax holidays and duty exemptions to attract investment. However, the manufacturing shift will be time-consuming as companies renegotiate terms with US buyers amid order deferrals and cancellations.",

The new tariff will double existing trade penalties to 50% total, targeting India for buying Russian oil. Vice Chairman and MD Sivaramakrishnan Ganapathi warned that brands may gradually shift business to other countries if the 50% duty remains, potentially causing India to lose its foothold in the US market. He emphasized that pivoting to alternative markets takes at least a year, making immediate support critical for exporters, particularly MSMEs. Jefferies analyst Mahesh Nandurkar noted the tariffs could put India's $87 billion worth of exports to the US at risk, equivalent to 2.2% of GDP. Textiles, chemicals, auto ancillaries, and fisheries are expected to be most impacted, while pharmaceutical and electronics exports remain exempt.",
