HDFC Life CEO Vibha Padalkar emphasized the need for individuals to take charge of retirement planning alongside adequate protection cover. The traditional joint family safety net is weakening as average household size declined from 4.6 in 2001 to 3.9 in 2018, shifting retirement planning responsibility to individuals. A significant portion of India's workforce, particularly in the unorganised sector, lacks access to retirement planning products. The industry is promoting accessible products like NPS and PPF while leveraging digital platforms for easier onboarding. Recent GST removal on individual life insurance policies aims to improve affordability and support the government's 'Insurance for All by 2047' vision. Insurers are redesigning products for younger investors with flexible premium terms and bundled health riders. Indian protection products remain relatively affordable, with costs 4-6 times lower than Singapore or the UK for similar coverage.",
