Operational EBITDA (excluding forex impact) reached INR 39.7 crore or 10.2% of revenues. However, reported EBITDA was INR 27.8 crore due to INR 12.5 crore adverse forex impact on Euro borrowings. The company reduced net debt by INR 60 crore and improved working capital cycle by 17 days. Management revised guidance to expect domestic MDF volume growth in high teens for FY26 and operating EBITDA margins of high single-digit to early double-digit. MDF imports dropped significantly to less than 1,000 cubic meters monthly versus 20,000 cubic meters average in previous year's second half, attributed to stricter BIS implementation.",
