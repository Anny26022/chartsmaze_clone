The GST Council reduced tax rates on term insurance and standard health insurance plans from 18% to 0%, while investment-linked products like ULIPs and endowment policies remain taxed at existing rates. Following the zero-GST implementation, term insurance demand increased 2.5 times compared to pre-announcement levels, while health insurance saw a 2.2x rise. The trend later stabilized at 1.8x for term insurance and 1.7x for health insurance. The GST removal reduces effective premium costs for policyholders and is expected to improve affordability, particularly benefiting first-time buyers. The purchase increase also coincided with the Navratri festive period, which typically sees heightened financial planning activity.",
