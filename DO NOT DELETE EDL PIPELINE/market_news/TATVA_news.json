The Tata Nano was unveiled in 2008 and gained global attention as the 'people's car.' Tata strategically chose Singur, West Bengal for manufacturing to help the industrially stagnant region and because it was represented by opposition leader Rabindranath Bhattacharya. However, the project faced protests from farmers who accused Tata Group of unfairly taking their land, with politician Mamata Banerjee supporting the farmers. The protests escalated, forcing Tata Group to withdraw from Singur in 2008 and move operations to Sanand, Gujarat. Radia noted that Tata believed the Singur project would have developed the Kolkata-Singur corridor similar to how Sanand has now developed into a manufacturing hub.",

The leadership is divided into two camps - one led by Noel Tata and another by Mehli Mistry. The Mistry camp claims it has been excluded from key strategic decisions at Tata Sons, while the Tata camp maintains its decisions benefit all shareholders. The conflict escalated after a contentious Tata Trusts meeting that resulted in Vijay Singh's exit from the Tata Sons board. The government is intervening due to concerns that Tata Group distress could impact the broader corporate sector. Discussions will also cover Tata Sons' mandatory listing under RBI guidelines. Tata Trusts owns 66% of Tata Sons, the group's primary investment arm. Tata Sons has applied to cancel its core investment company registration to avoid mandatory listing by September 2025 and has become net zero debt. The RBI is still considering the cancellation request.",
