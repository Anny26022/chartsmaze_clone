EBITDA stood at INR 32 crores with margins at 7.73%, while profit after tax was INR 22 crores, up 4% year-on-year. The company faced challenges from subdued demand and increased low-cost imports from China in both tyre cord fabrics and filament yarn segments. For H1 FY26, revenue declined 24% to INR 810 crores with total volumes down 14% to 34,992 metric tons. The industry is pursuing anti-dumping duties on nylon filament yarn imports from China. The company expects commercial supplies from its PTCF project to begin in Q4, with total investment of approximately INR 100 crores. Management anticipates better volumes in the second half supported by GST reductions on tyres and festive season demand, though geopolitical tensions and trade uncertainties remain key risks.",
