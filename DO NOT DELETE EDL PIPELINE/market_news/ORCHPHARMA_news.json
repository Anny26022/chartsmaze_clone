The company revised the allocation of QIP proceeds among project objectives following shareholder approval through AGM resolution dated September 20, 2025. Two key projects face implementation delays: the investment in Orchid BioPharma Limited for setting up manufacturing facility in Jammu, and funding capital expenditure for new API facility block in Alathur, Tamil Nadu, though the extent of delays remains unascertainable. For the Jammu project, Rs. 73.02 crores has been utilized as of September 30, 2025, with land acquisition challenges cited as the primary cause of delay. Registration of 164.50 Kanal out of 203.8 Kanal identified land has been completed, with remaining land registration expected by December 2025. The Alathur project delay is attributed to dependency on the Jammu 7ACA project, with only Rs. 0.36 crores utilized. The company has deployed unutilized proceeds in fixed deposits with Yes Bank Limited. CARE Ratings Limited served as the monitoring agency and reported no deviation from stated objectives.",

The company attributed this performance to an unprecedented global slowdown in the antibiotics market, with both prices and volumes under pressure. Despite challenges, the company maintained gross margins at around 42% and operational EBITDA of INR 14 crores. In a significant development, Orchid acquired global rights to Enmetazobactam and trademark Exblifep from Allecra following the latter's insolvency. This acquisition gives Orchid complete control over regulatory and commercial strategy for the novel antibiotic worldwide, with double-digit royalties from Advanz in Europe now flowing directly to Orchid. The product is already licensed in Europe, Middle East, and North African markets through existing agreements. Management expects the antibiotics market challenges to persist through the current year, with no revival anticipated in the near future.
