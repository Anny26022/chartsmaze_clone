            "Summary": "Dr Reddy's Laboratories and Hetero Labs announced they will sell generic versions of lenacapavir, an HIV prevention drug, for approximately $40 per year starting in 2027. The original drug, developed by Gilead Sciences and branded as Yeztugo, is a twice-yearly injection that showed nearly 100% effectiveness in preventing HIV during large trials, but costs around $28,000 annually in the US. Both companies received royalty-free licenses from Gilead to produce and sell the drug in 120 low- and lower-middle-income countries. Unitaid, Clinton Health Access Initiative, and Wits RHI are supporting Dr Reddy's efforts, while the Gates Foundation is working with Hetero. The generic pricing aims to match oral PrEP costs and could benefit millions in low-income countries. Experts estimate long-term demand could reach 10 million people or more, making affordable generics crucial for broader access.",
