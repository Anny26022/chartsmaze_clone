            "Summary": "Siddhartha Lal, executive chairman of Eicher Motors, has appealed to the government to implement a uniform 18% GST rate for all two-wheelers. In an Instagram post, Lal argued that a common GST rate would help India maintain its competitive edge in the global two-wheeler market. He warned that punitive GST on motorcycles above 350cc would limit Indian brands to smaller capacity vehicles and undermine their ability to build strong dealer networks and brand equity internationally. The appeal comes before the GST Council meeting on September 3-4, where the Group of Ministers' proposal to restructure tax slabs will be considered. The GoM has proposed only two slabs of 5% and 18%, eliminating the current 12% and 28% slabs, with an additional 40% slab for luxury goods that may include two-wheelers above 350cc. Lal stated that differential rates would shrink the domestic above 350cc segment and reduce investment needed for India to compete globally, allowing rivals from countries without such tax distortions to capture market share.",
