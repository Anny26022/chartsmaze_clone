            "Summary": "The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) Ahmedabad has directed Ambuja Cements Limited to convene a meeting of equity shareholders on December 30, 2025, at 11:00 a.m. IST via video conference to consider the proposed amalgamation scheme with Penna Cement Industries Limited. The scheme involves amalgamation of Penna Cement (transferor company) with Ambuja Cements (transferee company) with an appointed date of August 16, 2024. Ambuja Cements acquired 99.94% of Penna Cement's paid-up equity share capital. The NCLT dispensed with meetings for various stakeholder categories of both companies, including equity shareholders of Penna Cement (due to consent affidavits from 99.96% shareholders), and unsecured creditors of both companies (as no compromise is offered and liabilities remain unchanged). The tribunal appointed Justice Kalpesh Jhaveri as chairperson for the shareholder meeting. Both companies showed excess of assets over liabilities, with Penna Cement having Rs. 2,967.75 crores and Ambuja Cements having Rs. 48,967.16 crores as of June 30, 2025.",

Ambuja Cements, owned by the Adani Group, seeks to restrain JSW firms from using 'Kawach' in their product branding, alleging JSW copied the name for its 'Jal Kawach' cement product launched recently. Ambuja has used the registered trademark 'Ambuja Kawach' since 2020 for its water-repellent cement. The company claims JSW's 'JSW Cement CHD Jal Kawach' uses similar branding and marketing descriptors including 'water resistance,' 'seepage prevention,' and 'durability.' Ambuja contends this constitutes trademark infringement and unfair business practices aimed at leveraging its brand reputation. The court posted the matter for October 15 if mediation fails.
