            "Summary": "The US Food and Drug Administration issued a Warning Letter to Glenmark Pharmaceuticals for its Pithampur manufacturing facility following an inspection conducted between February 3 and February 14, 2025. The facility's methods, controls, and operations failed to comply with Current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations. The FDA flagged inadequate investigations into dissolution failures in potassium chloride extended-release capsules and another product, citing insufficient scientific justification in the company's responses. The agency also raised concerns over delayed stability testing, which resulted in late detection of product failures and subsequent delays in initiating recalls and issuing field alerts. This marks Glenmark's fourth FDA warning letter, with previous warnings issued to its Himachal Pradesh plant in October 2019, Goa facility in November 2022, and North Carolina site in June 2023. The FDA has recommended that Glenmark engage a qualified CGMP consultant and undertake a comprehensive review of its global quality systems. Despite the warning letter, Glenmark shares were trading 0.48% higher at \u20b92,149, with the stock gaining 33% in 2025.",

The revision reflects improved revenue visibility for subsidiary Ichnos Glenmark Innovation following an exclusive global licensing agreement with AbbVie Inc. for investigational asset ISB 2001. Under the agreement, Ichnos will receive an upfront payment of USD 700 million post regulatory clearance and is eligible for up to USD 1.225 billion in milestone payments plus tiered double-digit royalties. This represents one of the largest biotechnology licensing deals by an Indian company. The rating agency expects net leverage to remain strong over FY26-FY28 due to healthy operating profitability and significant cash buildup. Glenmark reported consolidated revenue growth of 12.8% to INR 133.2 billion in FY25, with EBITDA margin expanding to 17.7% from 10.1%. The India formulations business grew 31.9% while the US business declined 2.5%.
