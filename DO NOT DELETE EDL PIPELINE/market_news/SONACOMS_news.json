Sona BLW Precision Forgings experienced the largest drop in FPI holdings, falling to 23.5% from nearly 30% at the end of June. PNB Housing Finance saw foreign ownership decline to 18.6% from 24.2%. Other significantly affected stocks included Sammaan Capital, Indian Energy Exchange, and Computer Age Management Services, each witnessing at least 5 percentage point declines in foreign shareholding. The selloff was initially driven by expensive valuations and later intensified due to trade policy uncertainties imposed by US President Donald Trump. Since the beginning of 2025, foreign investors have sold $16.5 billion worth of Indian equities. However, overseas investors have turned modest buyers since October, adding about $550 million worth of shares. Indian equities continue trading at high valuations with Nifty50's one-year forward price-to-earnings multiple at 20.4 times.
