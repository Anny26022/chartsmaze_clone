            "Summary": "The Trump administration implemented an additional 25% tariff on Indian exports to the US, bringing total tariffs to 50%. Morgan Stanley analyzed the impact on Indian auto sector companies, noting that the US represents 38% of Bharat Forge's standalone revenue and 10% of Balkrishna Industries' topline. Both companies previously faced 10% tariffs during the June quarter and managed partial cost pass-through to customers. The tariff escalation now subjects 30% of Bharat Forge's standalone revenue and 10% of Balkrishna Industries' revenue to the 50% tariff rate. Morgan Stanley estimates this could result in an EBITDA impact of nearly 30% for Bharat Forge and around 10% for Balkrishna Industries. Bharat Forge shares closed 0.23% higher at \u20b91,124.50, while Balkrishna Industries ended 0.16% lower at \u20b92,320.40.",
