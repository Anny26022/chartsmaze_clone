The company's patented portfolio is expected to grow from 17% of revenue in FY25 to 22% by FY28, with key products including Ilumya, Cequa, Winlevi, and Leqselvi. Sun Pharma currently uses global contract manufacturers, with Ilumya manufactured in South Korea and Europe. The company has over $3 billion in cash as of June 2025, providing flexibility to relocate production to US facilities, though this could take 6-24 months and involve substantial costs.

Sun Pharma derives around 20% of its revenues from innovative drugs sold in the US and had not received such communication as of their last quarterly conference call. The Trump administration is seeking most favoured nation treatment for Medicaid pricing to match rates charged in other wealthy developed nations. Other pharmaceutical stocks also declined, with Aurobindo Pharma, Gland and Granules India falling 2-3%.
