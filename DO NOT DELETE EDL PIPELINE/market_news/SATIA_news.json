The rating reflects the company's integrated operations, healthy market position in state textbook segment with 10%-15% market share, and robust credit metrics with net leverage below 1x. The company operates a 205,000 MTPA paper manufacturing facility in Punjab and recorded revenue of INR15,120 million in FY25, down 12.1% from previous year due to softening paper prices. EBITDA margins moderated to 17.9% in FY25 from 24.3% in FY24. The company plans to upgrade its paper machine over six-to-nine months starting November 2025, adding 18,000-20,000 MTPA capacity but requiring temporary shutdown. India Ratings expects EBITDA to decline further in FY26 due to planned shutdown and volume impact, with gradual recovery expected from second half of FY27. The ratings are supported by the company's ability to use multiple feedstocks, operational efficiencies, and adequate liquidity with INR1,139 million in unencumbered cash.",
