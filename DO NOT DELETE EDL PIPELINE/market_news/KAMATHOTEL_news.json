EBITDA fell 63% to INR 8 crores with margins at 10.43%, and the company posted a loss of INR 30 lakhs compared to INR 8 crores profit in the previous year's quarter. For H1 FY26, revenue remained flat at INR 158 crores with EBITDA declining 28% to INR 26 crores. The company attributed poor performance to multiple factors including road washouts affecting Shimla and Manali properties, pre-opening expenses for 5 new hotels adding 280 rooms, renovation work at Orchid Pune impacting MICE business, and monsoon-related revenue drops in Mumbai and Maharashtra. Despite challenges, management maintains confidence in achieving INR 400 crore annual revenue guidance, citing strong Q3 wedding season bookings and improved performance from previously opened hotels. The company now operates 24 properties with 2,100 rooms and withdrew a pending merger proposal due to regulatory delays.",

He noted that the current 18% GST rate on hotels makes India less competitive compared to destinations like Thailand and Taiwan, potentially causing loss of foreign tourists. While restaurants benefit from a 5% GST rate, Kamat emphasized that rationalizing higher tax brackets is essential for attracting travelers and increasing forex inflows. He expects the changes to drive premiumization trends and alter customer behavior, particularly among repeat visitors who may upgrade to better products. Despite a soft first quarter, Kamat projects strong growth through September-November as consumers will have more disposable income. The GST Council is scheduled to decide on rate cuts for over 150 items during its September 3-4 meeting, with proposals to shift items from 12% and 18% slabs to 5% or nil GST categories.",
