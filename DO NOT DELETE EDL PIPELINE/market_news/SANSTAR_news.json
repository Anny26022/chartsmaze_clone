            "Summary": "Sanstar Limited reported revenue from operations of Rs. 1,689 million for Q1 FY26, down 44.2% from Rs. 3,027 million in Q1 FY25. Gross profit fell to Rs. 404 million with a margin of 23.9%, compared to Rs. 801 million and 26.5% margin in the previous year. The company recorded negative EBITDA of Rs. 17 million and negative PAT of Rs. 3 million. The decline was attributed to a 24-day annual maintenance shutdown at both plants and pricing pressure in the native starch segment due to increased Chinese exports. The company completed maintenance programs at its facilities with combined capacity of 1,100 TPD. Sanstar is expanding its Dhule facility capacity from 750 TPD to 1,750 TPD, with native starch manufacturing to be commissioned in December 2025 and derivatives facility in March 2026. This expansion will increase total company capacity from 1,100 TPD to 2,100 TPD, positioning Sanstar as India's second-largest producer of maize-based specialty products.",
