The agreement removes duties that previously disadvantaged Indian exporters compared to Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Cambodia. India currently exports $1.79 billion worth of textiles to the UK out of total UK textile imports of $26.95 billion, creating significant expansion potential. Analysts project Indian textile exports to the UK could double over the next five to six years with an anticipated 11% CAGR. The textile sector covers 1,143 tariff lines under the zero-duty arrangement, representing 11.7% of the agreement's scope. India expects to capture at least 5% additional UK market share within one to two years.
