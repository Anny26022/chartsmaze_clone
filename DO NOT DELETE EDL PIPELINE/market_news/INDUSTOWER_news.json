            "Summary": "Indus Towers delivered robust quarterly results with gross revenues growing 9.1% year-on-year to INR 80.6 billion and core rental revenue up 10.1% to INR 51.1 billion. The company added 2,468 macro towers and 5,777 co-locations during the quarter, bringing total macro towers to 251,800 and co-locations to 411,200. EBITDA declined 3.4% year-on-year to INR 43.9 billion with margins at 54.5%, impacted by weather-related disruptions causing increased diesel consumption. The Board decided to conserve cash in the short term, suspending dividend distribution until year-end review, citing evolving industry landscape, customer stability considerations, elevated capex, and inorganic growth opportunities. The company expanded its solar site count to over 32,000 sites and maintained network uptime of 99.96% despite challenging weather conditions. Management expects robust tower rollout momentum to continue based on strong order book visibility for the next 4-6 quarters.",

            "Summary": "Indus Towers shares fell over 4% to Rs 347.75 following the company's announcement to conserve cash in the short term rather than return it to shareholders. The passive telecom infrastructure company reported quarterly net profit declined 9.8% year-on-year to Rs 1,737 crore due to higher power, fuel, employee benefit, and maintenance costs, despite an Rs 88 crore write-back from Vodafone Idea receivables. Revenue rose 9.1% to Rs 8,058 crore with rental revenue growing 10.1%. BNP Paribas called the cash conservation decision 'perplexing' and lowered earnings estimates by 2-3% for FY26-28, noting the company's results were slightly below expectations. CEO Prachur Sah explained the decision stems from evolving industry landscape, elevated capex requirements, and potential inorganic growth opportunities. The company reported maintenance capex of Rs 1,190 crore in the first half of 2025, nearly matching full-year 2024 spending. Organic tower additions slowed from 4,300 to 2,500 quarter-over-quarter. Management clarified this is a short-term measure, not a permanent dividend policy change, with free cash flows remaining available for future distributions.",
