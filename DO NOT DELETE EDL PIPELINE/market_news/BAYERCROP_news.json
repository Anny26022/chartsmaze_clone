The year started strong with early monsoon boosting first quarter performance, but rainfall has since been inconsistent and erratic. Wiebusch noted that September will determine kharif season success, while Rabi outlook appears positive with well-filled dams and stable commodity prices for farmers. He emphasized India's significant growth potential as an under-penetrated market compared to other countries. However, he cautioned that external factors beyond traditional monsoon patterns increasingly influence sector performance. Regarding industry concerns about gross margin pressure from glyphosate pricing, Wiebusch indicated the worst may be over, suggesting the company has hit bottom in terms of gross margins on the chemical side. He acknowledged that external factors like industrial overcapacity in China could still impact the Indian market.",
