            "Summary": "India's reinsurance sector faces new competition as Jio-Allianz and Valueattics Re prepare to enter the \u20b950,000-crore market currently dominated by state-run GIC Re. Jio Financial Services and Allianz Group announced a binding agreement to form a 50:50 domestic reinsurance joint venture, with minimum paid-up capital of \u20b9200 crore. They also signed a non-binding agreement for general and life insurance joint ventures.

In 2023-24, total reinsurance premium collected was \u20b962,113 crore, with \u20b950,553 crore from Indian business. The new domestic reinsurers could benefit from regulatory preferences over cross-border reinsurers under IRDAI guidelines. Indian insurers must cede 4% of each policy to GIC Re under mandatory cession rules. Valueattics Re, a joint venture between Fairfax's Prem Watsa and Kamesh Goyal's Oben Ventures, entered the market in March. The entry brings scale and digital reach from Reliance Industries through Jio-Allianz, while Valueattics Re offers Fairfax's global expertise and balance sheet strength.",
