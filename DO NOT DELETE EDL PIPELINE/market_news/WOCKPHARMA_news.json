The company expects a healthy bottom line in coming quarters following the US exit. Wockhardt's flagship antibiotic Zaynich, manufactured in Europe, will remain unaffected by potential US-India trade tariffs. The company plans to file a New Drug Application with USFDA for Zaynich in September 2025, expecting approval by mid-2026, while anticipating commercial launch in India by early 2026. Clinical trials for another antibiotic Foviscu are expected to conclude by October 2025.
