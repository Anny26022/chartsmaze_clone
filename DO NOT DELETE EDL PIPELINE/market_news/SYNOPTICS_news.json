            "Summary": "Sebi confirmed its market ban on Synoptics Technologies and its promoters Jatin Shah, Jagmohan Manilal Shah, and Janvi Jatin Shah pending investigation into alleged IPO proceeds siphoning. The regulator found that Rs 19 crore was transferred for 'issue management fees, underwriting and selling commissions, registrar fees, and other IPO related expenses,' significantly exceeding the Rs 80 lakh disclosed as issue expenses in the red herring prospectus. This amount represented over 54% of the Rs 35.08 crore raised through fresh share issue and 35% of the total Rs 54.04 crore issue size. Lead manager First Overseas Capital Ltd has been barred from new merchant banking assignments. Synoptics Technologies raised funds through an SME IPO in July 2023, with FOCL serving as lead manager. The action followed complaints about irregularities in the bidding process after IPO closure.",
