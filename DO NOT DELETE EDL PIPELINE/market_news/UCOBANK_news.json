Senior executives from the state-owned lender met with finance ministry officials and were asked to take the lead in executing payments for Nayara, which is part-owned by Russian oil major Rosneft. Operational details including currency choice are still being worked out. Nayara had approached government officials for help securing a domestic lender with limited offshore presence to support crude oil import payments and receive payments for refined fuel exports. Since being sanctioned in July, Nayara has faced significant operational challenges - large institutions including State Bank of India have stopped processing transactions, ships have diverted from its terminal, and the company has cut run rates while seeking advance payments. Rosneft owns just over 49% of Nayara, which accounts for nearly 8% of India's refining capacity and 7% of its retail-fuel network.",
