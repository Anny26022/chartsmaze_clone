            "Summary": "Gateway Distriparks reported rail EBITDA per TEU of INR 9,300 and CFS EBITDA per TEU of INR 1,000 for Q2 FY26. The company expects 10-15% volume growth over the next 2-3 years from existing locations, driven by trade deals with UK, EU, and US. Double stack percentage increased from 39% to 41% quarter-over-quarter. However, CFS margins were impacted by one-off legal costs, repair expenses, and a dip in exports due to US tariffs. The company has commenced domestic services from Ankleshwar, targeting 1,000+ TEUs monthly within two years. Snowman Logistics faced challenges in its transportation segment, with PBT margins dropping to breakeven levels due to realignment of the business model and removal of low-margin operations. The warehousing segment maintained INR 60 crores revenue but saw PBT margins decline from 12% to 3% due to reduced capacity utilization, weather-related power cuts increasing diesel consumption, and stress in seafood warehouses. Management expects positive traction from December onwards and aims to restore transportation margins to high single-digit PBT levels.",
