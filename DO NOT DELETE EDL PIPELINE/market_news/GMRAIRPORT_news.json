Morgan Stanley stepped in to cover the shortfall after limited investor interest. HDFC Mutual Fund invested \u20b9400 crore, Aditya Birla MF \u20b9200 crore, Citibank \u20b9200 crore, and \u20b975 crore each from Axis MF and Nippon India MF. In contrast, GMR's \u20b94,400-crore bank tranche with three-year maturity at 10.50% was fully subscribed, with Deutsche Bank taking \u20b91,500 crore and SBI Mutual Fund \u20b91,050 crore among other investors. The restricted investor base and migration of the segment to AIFs and private credit funds contributed to subdued mutual fund interest. The fundraise is expected to reduce GMR Airports' average borrowing cost by nearly 3 percentage points. Crisil assigned an A+ rating to the newly-issued NCD.",
