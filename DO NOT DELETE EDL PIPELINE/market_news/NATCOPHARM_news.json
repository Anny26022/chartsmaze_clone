The acquisition provides NATCO access to the African market and established brands, each generating over $10 million in revenue. NATCO plans to leverage its R&D pipeline and introduce products like Semaglutide to South Africa while exploring manufacturing synergies. The transaction is expected to close within 3-4 months, with NATCO retaining approximately \u20b91,500 crores in cash post-acquisition. The combined entity will approach $1 billion in revenue, marking NATCO's largest investment to date.",
