Over time, newer generations brought confidence and openness, asking questions and addressing seniors by first names rather than formal titles. The 74-year-old chairman said he initially needed time to adjust but now welcomes this shift, viewing it as progress rather than disrespect. Mariwala emphasized that true leadership involves creating environments where people feel heard, valued, and trusted to challenge ideas. His social media post received significant engagement, with over 430 comments on LinkedIn and mixed reactions from users - some praising his mindset while others defended traditional Indian workplace customs. Mariwala founded Marico in 1990, which became a leading FMCG company with brands like Parachute, Saffola and Set Wet.",
