The stock trades below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of Rs 5,584 and Rs 5,879 respectively. For quarterly results, brokerages expect strong revenue growth up to 36% driven by store expansion, particularly Zudio format stores. However, EBITDA margins are likely to contract due to soft same-store sales growth, cost inflation, and competitive pressures. Analysts are divided on profit expectations, with two out of four estimates indicating a decline in profit after tax while others forecast low single-digit growth. Brokerage recommendations vary, with PhillipCapital maintaining a negative view, Motilal Oswal giving a Buy rating with Rs 6,600 target, and Kotak Institutional Equities suggesting Reduce with Rs 5,300 target.",

The company announced layoffs of approximately 12,000 employees and reported revenue that missed consensus estimates, falling 3.3% quarter-on-quarter in constant currency terms. Deal wins totaled $9.4 billion with no mega deals included. Multiple brokerages have downgraded TCS, with Nomura cutting EPS estimates and lowering target price to Rs 3,780. Trent's standalone revenue growth slowed to 20% in Q1 FY26, significantly below its five-year CAGR of 35%. The company guided for around 20% growth in its core fashion business, falling short of its previous 25%+ growth aspirations.
