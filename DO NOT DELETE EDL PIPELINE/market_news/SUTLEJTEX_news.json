            "Summary": "India Ratings and Research downgraded Sutlej Textiles and Industries Limited's Long-Term Issuer Rating to IND A- with a Negative Outlook from IND A-. The downgrade reflects expectations of lower-than-expected EBITDA improvement over FY26-FY28, leading to continued elevated net adjusted leverage above 5.0x and low interest coverage of 1.0x-1.75x. This is attributed to planned capex towards modernization, upgradation and value-added products, which would increase debt and leverage over FY26-FY28. The company's bank loan facilities totaling Rs. 13,465.1 million were also downgraded while short-term ratings were affirmed. Despite EBITDA improvement in FY25, it remained volatile over FY22-1QFY26. The capex of around Rs. 6,500 million over FY26-FY30 is discretionary and depends on cash generation, internal accruals, fund infusion and debt tie-ups. The company reported revenue of Rs. 26,832 million in FY25 with EBITDA of Rs. 493 million and EBITDA margins of 1.84%.",
