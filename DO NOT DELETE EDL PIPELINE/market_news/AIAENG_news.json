This represents the company's first customer using hi-chrome for grinding media in that region. The company is conducting trials at multiple mining sites and expects potential volume growth of 30,000 tons annually from next year, driven by its integrated liner and grinding media package solutions. Management indicated that most future sales will come from solution-based offerings rather than individual products, which could help avoid anti-dumping and pricing pressures.
