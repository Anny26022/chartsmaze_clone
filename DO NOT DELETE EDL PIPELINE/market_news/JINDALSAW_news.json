The company faced challenges including cash flow issues with EPC contractors in the water sector (which represents 60% of business), geopolitical conflicts in MENA regions causing export shipment deferrals of approximately 20,000 tons from Q1 to Q2, and scheduled maintenance shutdowns. One blast furnace in Mundra remained under maintenance for 2 months in Q1, impacting production by 40,000-50,000 tons, while the pellet plant in Bhilwara was under maintenance for over a month, resulting in loss of 120,000-130,000 tons of pellet production. Despite these challenges, the company maintained EBITDA of approximately 16%. Working capital borrowings increased while long-term debt decreased after prepaying the entire term loan for Sathavahana facility acquisition. The company now carries long-term debt of less than INR 600 crores, primarily INR 500 crores of LIC bonds payable in 2028-30. UAE operations performed well with sales of approximately $60 million and order book of $270 million. The company has announced three new projects in GCC and MENA regions: a seamless pipe plant in Abu Dhabi, a helical pipe plant in Saudi Arabia, and a DI facility in Saudi Arabia, expected to be operational in 2-3 years. Current order book stands at approximately $1.5 billion with 16 lakh tons of confirmed orders and 2.65 lakh tons of LOIs for ductile domestic market.",

Sales volumes also decreased, with iron & steel pipes sales dropping 19% to 326,000 MT and pellets sales falling 46% to 222,000 MT. The company attributed the decline to scheduled maintenance of blast furnace and pellet plant, deferred export shipments due to military conflict in the MENA region, and increased receivables from domestic customers facing funding challenges. Despite operational challenges, Jindal Saw maintains a strong order book of $1,305 million for pipes and pellets, expected to be executed over 9-12 months.
