The scheme separates broking and non-broking businesses to comply with Securities Contract Regulations Rules that restrict stock exchange members from engaging in non-securities businesses. Under the arrangement, Almondz Global Securities' broking business will be demerged into Almondz Broking Services Limited, which will retain the Almondz Global Securities name and seek stock exchange listing. The remaining non-broking business of Almondz Global Securities, along with five other companies (Almondz Insolvency Resolutions Services, Almondz Finanz, Apricot Infosoft, Avonmore Developer, and Anemone Holding), will be amalgamated into Avonmore Capital. The share exchange ratios include 1:1 for the demerged broking entity and 967:1000 for the remaining business amalgamation. Post-scheme, Avonmore Capital's promoter shareholding will decrease from 58.38% to 45.40%. The scheme requires approvals from the National Company Law Tribunal, shareholders, creditors, and regulatory authorities.",
