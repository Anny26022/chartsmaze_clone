            "Summary": "GMR Energy raised Rs 1,600 crore through five-year non-convertible debt priced at 14.85%. The issue attracted investors including Allianz Global, Trust, and DSP Finance. The coupon rate is more than twice the existing risk-free rate on comparable duration. Proceeds will be used to partly repay existing loans and extend intra-group lending. Some investors plan to offload portions of the debt in the secondary market to large foreign banks and family offices. The higher cost reflects the holding company structure and reduced foreign bank interest in thermal power producers. GMR Group has been increasing its stake in GMR Energy, rising from 58% to nearly 87% after acquiring Tenaga Nasional's 29% stake and signing a deal for Temasek's 12% stake, which will make it almost 99% owned. The company operates four power assets including GMR Kamalanga (1,050 MW thermal) and GMR Warora (600 MW thermal). GMR's airport business separately raised Rs 6,000 crore across two tranches at rates of 10.35% and 10.50%.",
