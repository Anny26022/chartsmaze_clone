The dispute stems from an ongoing contractual disagreement where both parties have issued termination notices to each other. WEPL had previously received a favorable arbitration award dated July 31, 2024, which addressed similar issues raised by NHAI. The company believes the demand for premium contradicts the principles established by this arbitration award. NHAI has also claimed INR 351.46 crores, which WEPL is disputing. The Concession Agreement was terminated effective July 15, 2025, following WEPL's termination notice to NHAI for various contractual defaults. Based on external legal advisers' views, the company maintains it has a favorable legal position and expects no significant financial implications.",
