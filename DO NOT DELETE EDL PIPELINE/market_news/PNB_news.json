            "Summary": "A Belgian court has ruled that fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi faces no risk of unfair trial or ill-treatment if extradited to India for his role in the Rs 13,000 crore Punjab National Bank scam. The Court of Appeals in Antwerp upheld arrest warrants issued by a Mumbai special court, allowing Choksi's extradition. Choksi and his nephew Nirav Modi are accused of swindling Rs 13,000 crore through fraudulent letters of undertaking in collusion with bank officials at PNB's Brady House branch. A specially prepared cell at Mumbai's Arthur Road Jail has been readied for Choksi, featuring amenities including TV, newspapers, natural light, and videoconferencing facilities. India provided assurances to Belgian authorities regarding Choksi's safety, prison arrangements, and human rights. Choksi has been imprisoned in Antwerp since April, with multiple bail petitions rejected. He had fled to Antigua and Barbuda before the scam was detected and obtained citizenship there, though he remains an Indian citizen.",

            "Summary": "Punjab National Bank CEO Ashok Chandra estimates the bank will face a \u20b990 billion ($1 billion) impact when transitioning to the Reserve Bank of India's new Expected Credit Loss framework. The RBI's draft rules require banks to shift from the current incurred-loss model to a forward-looking system that anticipates potential future losses. Under the new framework, banks must classify loans into three stages of credit risk and provide for expected losses based on exposure quality. The changes take effect from April 2027 and align India's system with global IFRS 9 norms. Most of PNB's impact will come from Stage 2 assets, which could reduce the bank's capital ratio by about 0.85 percentage points. PNB expects to absorb the impact through earnings as India's banking sector prepares for more risk-sensitive provisioning requirements.",
