            "Summary": "Jammu and Kashmir Bank delivered its highest-ever first quarter net profit of \u20b9485 crores, marking a 16.7% year-on-year growth despite challenging circumstances including the Pahalgam terror incident and regional tensions. The bank's profitability was impacted by a one-time impairment provision of \u20b987 crores related to its investment in J&K Grameen Bank due to RRB amalgamation under government directives. Excluding this provision, net profit growth would exceed 30% year-on-year. The bank achieved above-average deposit growth of 12.1% compared to industry average of 10.1%, though CASA ratio declined from 47.01% to 45.71% as customers migrated to term deposits. Credit growth remained muted at 6.1% year-on-year with a 2.7% quarterly decline. Net Interest Margin contracted to 3.72% due to faster transmission of rate cuts on lending side versus deposit costs. Gross NPA increased slightly to 3.5% while maintaining provision coverage ratio above 90%. The bank maintained its guidance for credit growth of 12%, deposit growth of 10%, and CASA ratio of 48% for the financial year, while revising NIM guidance downward to 3.65%-3.70% following RBI's 50 basis points rate cut.",

The bank achieved above-average deposit growth of 12.1% compared to the industry average of 10.1%, though CASA ratio declined from 47.01% to 45.71% as customers migrated to term deposits for higher yields. Loan growth remained muted at 6.1% YoY with a 2.7% decline in the quarter, attributed to flat corporate lending and scheduled repayments.
