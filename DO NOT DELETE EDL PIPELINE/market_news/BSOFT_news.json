The Pune-based IT services company experienced heavy trading with volumes reaching a four-month high of around 70 lakh shares, significantly above the 20-day average of 2.4 lakh. The stock broke above key technical levels, crossing its 50-day moving average at \u20b9366 and 100-day moving average at \u20b9391. The surge was attributed to relief from Trump administration's clarification that the $100,000 H-1B visa fee will not apply to F-1 student visa holders, L-1 intra-company transferees, or current H-1B visa holders seeking renewals or extensions. This provides relief to Indian IT firms, as Indians account for about 70% of all new H-1B visa allocations with around 300,000 Indian workers currently in the US on H-1B visas.
