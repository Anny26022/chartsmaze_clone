The FTA will immediately reduce import duties on Scotch whisky and gin from 150% to 75%, with further cuts to 40% over ten years. This could lower consumer prices for imported spirits by Rs 100 to Rs 300 per bottle, benefiting multinational brands like Johnnie Walker, Chivas Regal, and Ballantine's. However, the actual consumer price impact may be limited due to state-level pricing mechanisms and excise duties. The Brewers Association of India noted that any price drops may be temporary or limited in scope.",
