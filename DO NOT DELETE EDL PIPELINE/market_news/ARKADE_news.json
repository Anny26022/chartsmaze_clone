Amit Jain, CMD of Arkade Developers, states that fractional real estate delivers consistent net yields of 7-8% while reducing entry barriers. The model provides professional management, reducing operational complexities for investors. With interest rates stabilizing and inflation cooling, fractional real estate is positioned as an alternative to fixed income investments, offering steady rental yields combined with potential capital appreciation. Unlike direct ownership, fractional platforms handle leasing management and maintenance, enabling investors to earn yields without operational involvement. While office assets remain the most attractive segment due to predictable yields, fractional ownership could expand into residential and holiday homes over the next 3-5 years, particularly appealing to younger investors seeking both utility and returns.",
