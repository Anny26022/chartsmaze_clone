            "Summary": "Petronet LNG Ltd., India's largest natural gas importer, is seeking a loan of at least 120 billion rupees ($1.4 billion) for a new petrochemical plant and LNG terminal. Local lenders including Axis Bank, State Bank of India, and Union Bank of India are considering joining the facility, with SBI Capital Markets appointed as adviser. The loan proceeds will partially fund construction of a petrochemical complex in Dahej, Gujarat, estimated to cost 206.85 billion rupees, helping diversify the company's earnings beyond LNG. The company is also establishing a five million tons land-based LNG import terminal at Gopalpur, Odisha. The loan could carry a tenor of more than 10 years with pricing potentially lower than SBI's current 7.95% lending rate. This represents one of Petronet's largest fundraising exercises and would be among the biggest local currency loans in India this year, occurring during a period when bank lending growth has slowed to 9.5%.",
