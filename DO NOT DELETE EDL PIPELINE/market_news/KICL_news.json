Meanwhile, Stakeholders Empowerment Services (SES) has recommended voting in favor of Amit Kalyani's appointment, stating no governance concerns were identified. The Pune sessions court order directing reinvestigation into a 2017 suicide case involving Amit Kalyani has been stayed by the Bombay High Court.",
