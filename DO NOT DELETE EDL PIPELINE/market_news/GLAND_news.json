However, Gland Pharma's rising stock price poses a challenge, with shares appreciating 10% year-to-date and 16% in the past month, closing at Rs 2,000. The company's market capitalization has reached Rs 32,964.47 crore. Most investors view the stock as overpriced and are seeking discounts to current levels. Gland Pharma develops and manufactures generic injectables for nearly 90 countries, with focus on Indian and US markets. The company posted revenue of Rs 5,616 crore and after-tax profit of Rs 698 crore.
