In contrast, older demographics show higher adoption rates: 26-35 years (18.02%), 36-45 years (32.36%), and 46-55 years (27.30%). Product adoption among under-25 customers remains minimal across categories - 0.96% for term insurance, 1.99% for ULIPs, and 2.71% for traditional plans. ABSLI attributes this gap to behavioral factors including preference for immediate gratification, risk underestimation, overconfidence in health, and financial decision-making inertia. The company suggests repositioning life insurance as a lifestyle choice through digital-first, simplified, and goal-based offerings. MD & CEO Kamlesh Rao emphasized the need to reframe insurance as a lifestyle enabler rather than just a safety net, with products aligned to youth ambitions and delivered in formats native to them.",
