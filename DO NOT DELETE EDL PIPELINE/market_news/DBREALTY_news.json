The National Company Law Tribunal sanctioned the composite scheme on June 12, 2025, which became effective July 1, 2025. Under the arrangement, shareholders received 1 AHIL share for every 10 VEL shares held as of July 18, 2025. The company advises shareholders to apportion their original acquisition costs with 81.47% attributed to VEL shares and 18.53% to AHIL shares. For example, if 1,000 VEL shares were acquired at \u20b9200 per share (\u20b92,00,000 total), the post-demerger cost would be \u20b9162,940 for VEL shares and \u20b937,060 for AHIL shares. The scheme qualifies under Income Tax Act provisions, with AHIL share allotment not considered a transfer and original VEL acquisition dates applying to AHIL shares.
