The decline stems from operational uncertainty, with sluggish customer decision-making delaying order conversions and JPMorgan expecting soft large-ticket business in the second half. Analysts believe the company has passed its margin peaks and revenues have been lower than anticipated due to macro factors. However, JPMorgan and Ambit Capital expect faster order conversion and stronger project pipeline ahead, with potential recovery in process industries capital expenditure supporting medium-term growth.
