The cost savings will flow through gradually over one to two quarters as new tenders are issued and fresh material orders are placed. Affordable and mid-market housing segments are expected to benefit most due to tight margins and higher material cost sensitivity. The timing coincides with festive season, which traditionally drives a 15-20% increase in housing enquiries. New GST rates are expected to reflect in tender negotiations within 30-90 days, and visible market pricing adjustments should emerge over the next three to nine months.
