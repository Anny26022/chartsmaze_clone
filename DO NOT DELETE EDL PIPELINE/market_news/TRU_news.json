Similarly, Infomerics downgraded bank facilities totaling \u20b9185 crore to 'IVR C' from 'IVR BBB'. The downgrades followed TruCap's inability to service interest and principal payments of \u20b972.28 crore on its non-convertible debentures that were due on July 16, 2025. The company faced severe liquidity pressure due to non-receipt of committed funds from new promoter entity Marwadi Chandarana Intermediaries Brokers Private Limited and premature redemption demands from debenture holders. The ratings remain on watch with developing implications, reflecting uncertainty around the proposed acquisition by the Marwadi Group. TruCap's financial performance showed a net loss of \u20b966.61 crore for the latest year compared to a profit of \u20b911.71 crore in the previous year, while gross NPAs increased to 3.69% from 1.33%.",
