The company had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding in April 2014 to sell 3 acres and 28 guntas of land in Hyderabad for Rs. 85 crores. PBSAMP had advanced Rs. 15.5 crores but HLV could not complete the transaction due to inability to settle balance claims and obtain government permission under the Urban Land Ceiling Act. PBSAMP terminated the agreement and demanded refund with 21% annual interest. After arbitration proceedings resulted in an award of Rs. 35 crores against HLV, the company paid Rs. 44.42 crores to satisfy the award. However, PBSAMP challenged the execution court's order through the Telangana High Court. The Supreme Court of India has now set aside the High Court's order and confirmed the execution court's decision, ruling that no further amount is payable by HLV Limited to PBSAMP Projects.",
