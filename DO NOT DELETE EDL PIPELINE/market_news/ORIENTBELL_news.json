The downgrade reflects moderation in business risk profile marked by steady decline in revenue and profitability over the years. Revenue remained stagnant at Rs 672 crore in fiscal 2025 compared to Rs 677 crore in fiscal 2024 due to reduced demand in domestic and export markets. Operating margin improved to 4.4% in fiscal 2025 from 3.4% in fiscal 2024, supported by vitrified tiles commanding premium pricing, but remains below CRISIL's expectation of 5.5-6.0%. The company faces challenges from high marketing expenditure, low offtake and intense competition resulting in lower product realisation. Revenue growth is expected to remain rangebound at 4-5% in fiscal 2026. The ratings continue to reflect the company's established position in the tiles industry, diversified geographical reach and healthy financial risk profile with comfortable gearing at 0.14 times and strong liquidity supported by Rs 30 crore cash and bank balance.",
