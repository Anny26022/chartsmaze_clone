            "Summary": "Symphony Limited reported a challenging second quarter with standalone revenue falling to \u20b9155 crores from \u20b9259 crores in the previous year. EBITDA dropped to \u20b927 crores from \u20b972 crores, while profit after tax declined to \u20b928 crores from \u20b967 crores. The company attributed the poor performance to an exceptionally weak summer season in 2025, contrasting with the phenomenal summer of 2024. Despite the quarterly decline, management noted that the first six months still represented the third-highest performance in company history. The air cooler industry experienced substantial degrowth across all players. Symphony's round-the-year product portfolio, including tower fans, kitchen cooling fans, water heaters, and exports, contributed 21% of quarterly revenue and 26% of trailing 12-month revenue. Channel inventory levels remain slightly higher than normal due to reduced sales, though management expects normalization as the season approaches. The company launched 9 new air cooler models in the AirForce range targeting mass and rural markets, along with 8 new water heater models. Symphony's treasury stands at \u20b9577 crores as of September 30, 2025, compared to \u20b9685 crores previously.",
