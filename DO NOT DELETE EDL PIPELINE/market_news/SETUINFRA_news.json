The company has been under Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process since November 28, 2022, after State Bank of India filed an application. The National Company Law Tribunal rejected a resolution plan in March 2025, and an appeal has been filed with NCLAT in July 2025. Due to non-payment of outstanding fees by previous management, depositories NSDL, CDSL and the Registrar and Transfer Agent have stopped providing shareholding data. The company cannot submit shareholding patterns, reconciliation reports, compliance certificates, and investor complaint reports. However, the company is exempted from filing corporate governance reports under SEBI regulations due to its insolvency status.",
