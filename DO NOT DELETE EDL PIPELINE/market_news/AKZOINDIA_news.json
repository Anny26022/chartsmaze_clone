            "Summary": "Akzo Nobel India Limited reported a 4% revenue decline with flat volumes in Q1 FY26. The decorative paints business saw a decline marginally higher than the company average, while the coatings business experienced low single-digit growth compared to previous high single-digit growth. Gross margins faced dilution due to business mix skewing toward lower-margin segments like coil coatings. The company made investments in digital projects for lead management, impacting EBIT and EBITDA. June saw significant decline attributed to the strategic review process, with dealer apprehension regarding warranties and service continuity. Management reported recovery in July following reassurance measures. The company operates with an 80-20 retail-to-projects split in decoratives and overall 57-43 paints-to-coatings ratio. Employee salary increments averaged 6.5%. The powder coatings business has been sold to AkzoNobel Global, with proceeds distributed as dividends. JSW Group's acquisition is expected to complete by December 2025, with both companies running separately initially. Management targets high single-digit growth for FY26.",
