            "Title": "HUL Q2 Results Preview: Profit Expected to Drop 5% as GST Changes and Weak Demand Impact Performance",
            "Summary": "Hindustan Unilever Ltd is expected to report subdued quarterly results with sales rising just 1% year-on-year while profit may decline 5%. The performance reflects challenges from recent GST rate cuts from 18% to 5% affecting nearly 40% of HUL's product portfolio including soaps, shampoos, detergents, toothpaste, and packaged foods. This GST transition led to channel de-stocking and inventory realignment issues. Extended monsoon disrupted sales momentum, particularly impacting skin care and seasonal products, while weak underlying demand and channel destocking weighed on volumes. Margins face pressure as EBITDA margin is expected to fall by 140 basis points to around 22.1%, driven by lower prices passed to consumers and increased promotional spending to clear older inventory. Raw material costs show mixed trends with palm oil and crude-based inputs remaining volatile, while tea prices have softened and coffee stays near 52-week highs. Analysts view the weakness as largely temporary, expecting recovery in coming quarters once GST impact normalizes. Despite weak quarterly performance, brokerages remain positive on medium-term prospects citing structural demand recovery, softer input costs, and GST-driven price rationalization that could boost affordability.",

            "Summary": "Hindustan Unilever, India's largest FMCG company, expects flat to low single-digit consolidated business growth for the September quarter compared to the previous year. The company attributes this to trade and channel disruption caused by GST rate rationalization that took effect on September 22, which reduced prices of essential goods including FMCG items. HUL anticipates the impact will continue through October, with recovery expected from November. Morgan Stanley maintained an 'equalweight' rating with a \u20b92,335 price target, noting the commentary was below market expectations due to delayed consumer pantry buying. Jefferies maintained a 'buy' rating with a \u20b93,000 price target, expecting similar impacts across other FMCG companies. Among 44 analysts covering HUL, 33 recommend 'buy', nine suggest 'hold', and two advise 'sell'. HUL shares closed 1% lower at \u20b92,512 and are down 5.5% over the past month.",

CFO Ritesh Tiwari outlined the company's approach centered on six priority demand spaces: tea and coffee, lifestyle nutrition, out-of-home food solutions, condiments, mini-meals, and accompaniments. The strategy involves using Kissan for Indian cuisine, Knorr for international cuisine, and Hellmann's for condiments, while avoiding the staples category. HUL's beverages portfolio showed double-digit growth in coffee and high single-digit growth in tea. The company plans a Horlicks relaunch with product changes to boost category consumption, acknowledging that more work is needed despite gaining market share. Unlike its global parent Unilever which sold tea businesses worldwide, HUL retained its tea and coffee operations due to growth potential and ownership advantages. Tiwari ruled out separating the Foods business, citing synergies across supply chain, distribution, and go-to-market structures in running the \u20b962,000 crore business. HUL expects sequential improvement in growth over the next few quarters, with the first half of FY25 expected to outperform the latter half of FY24.",
