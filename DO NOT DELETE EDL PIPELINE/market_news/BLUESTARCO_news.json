The reforms are expected to reduce GST on ACs from 28% to 18% under a new two-slab structure (5% and 18%) announced by PM Modi during his Independence Day speech. The changes are expected to roll out by October, around Diwali. Thiagarajan noted that August sales will be severely impacted as customers postpone purchases to benefit from lower taxes. He emphasized that early notification of the new rates, ideally before September 1, would minimize industry pain during the festive season including Ganesh Chaturthi, Navratri and Diwali. While B2B customers may continue purchasing due to input tax credit benefits, individual consumers are likely to wait. Dealers are expected to take bookings rather than immediate sales. Despite short-term challenges, Thiagarajan expects the AC industry to achieve 15-20% growth for FY26 once the reforms are implemented.",
