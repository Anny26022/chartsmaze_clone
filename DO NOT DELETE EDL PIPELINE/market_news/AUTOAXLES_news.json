The company achieved EBITDA margin of 12.4% compared to 11.7% in the previous quarter and 11.4% in the same period last year. The decline was attributed to product mix changes, reduced tipper sales due to monsoon season, and impact from tariffs on exports, particularly from the US market which is down 30-40%. The MHCV market did around 95,000-98,000 vehicles in the quarter. The company launched new products including a 15-meter bus axle and axles for electric vehicle applications (4x2 electric tractor trailer and 8x4 electric tipper). Automotive Axles won a silver award from Ashok Leyland for aftermarket performance, achieving 98% delivery performance. Management expects Q3 and Q4 to end strongly, potentially better than last year, supported by GST revisions and domestic consumption. The company maintains 60-70% share of business with Ashok Leyland and high double-digit share with Mahindra and Daimler. CFO Ranganathan S. announced his retirement effective November 21st after 11 years with the company.",
