Cables business maintained steady growth momentum driven by strong power cables performance, with the company acquiring 39 acres of land adjacent to existing Alwar facility for capacity expansion. LED price stabilization in lighting showed initial pickup in residential demand. Lloyd segment faced significant decline in contribution margins due to customer support schemes offered to clear channel inventories, though these schemes have been withdrawn following GST changes. Higher working capital levels, especially for cables and Lloyd, led to reduced cash balances and lower interest income. The company remains optimistic about second half performance following recent GST rate reductions on air conditioners, TVs and solar products.
