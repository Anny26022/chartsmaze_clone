EBITDA dropped significantly to INR 94 crores from INR 207 crores in the previous year. The company will now report as a single entity rather than splitting PVC resin and pipes segments, as PVC resin is almost entirely for captive consumption. The company maintains a strong balance sheet with net cash surplus of INR 2,533 crores. Management expects high single-digit growth going forward and anticipates double-digit industry growth for the year. A new Managing Director has been approved by the Board and will join soon, with current MD Saurabh Dhanorkar continuing in an advisory capacity.",
