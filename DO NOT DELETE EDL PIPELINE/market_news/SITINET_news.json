            "Summary": "The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal dismissed appeals filed by Axis Bank, Aditya Birla Capital, IDBI Bank, IndusInd Bank, and RBL Bank against SITI Networks Limited. The banks had withdrawn \u20b9143.15 crore from SITI Networks' account during a stay period between March 2023 and August 2023, when the company's insolvency proceedings were temporarily halted. NCLAT ruled that the moratorium remained in effect despite the stay order and directed all financial creditors to return the withdrawn amounts to the corporate debtor with accrued interest. The tribunal applied the principle of restitution, stating that parties who benefited from interim orders must restore those benefits when appeals are ultimately dismissed. NCLAT rejected the banks' arguments that they had contractual rights to withdraw funds, emphasizing that insolvency proceedings are 'in rem' and continue even during stay periods. The judgment also criticized the Resolution Professional for improperly handing over management to suspended directors during the stay period.",
