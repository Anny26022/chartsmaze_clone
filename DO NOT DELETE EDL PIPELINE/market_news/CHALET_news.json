The company views recent GST rate rationalization as providing tailwinds for the hotel industry by putting more money in consumers' pockets. The new 5% GST rate for hotel rooms below Rs 7,500 will have minimal impact on Chalet Hotels, as only single-digit percentage of their room nights are sold below this threshold. Sethi dismissed any plans to reprice rooms to take advantage of the lower tax bracket. He advocated for reversing the withdrawal of Input Tax Credit for rooms under Rs 7,500 and suggested raising the threshold to Rs 12,000, linked to the Consumer Price Index.
