A Thane businessman lost over Rs 40 lakh after responding to Facebook ads promoting stock market investments. The fraudsters directed victims to a WhatsApp group called VIP3 TriGen-Fortune Code and asked them to download a fake TriGen-App. The app showed fabricated profits but prevented withdrawals, pressuring users to invest more money. The businessman made multiple transfers between May 26-30, ranging from Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000 each time. When he attempted to withdraw funds, the app and group administrators disappeared. Prime Securities confirmed no connection to the fraudulent activities and filed complaints with Colaba Police Station and the National Cybercrime Reporting Portal. The company engaged cybersecurity firm CYBLE Inc. and successfully had the fake app removed from Google Play Store. Prime Securities advised investors to verify apps through official company websites only.",
