Due to recent financial problems in MMTC, the company''s business/offices have been severely downsized and further advised for reduction in manpower through VRS with MOC approval.  This has resulted in some operational issues leading to delay in receipt of accounts/details from regional offices. CAG/Statutory Auditor queries on the accounts for the year 2021-22 are also being addressed which may have an effect of first quarter accounts for 2022-23. MMTC is trying to finalise the accounts by the end of this month.  3.Keeping the above circumstances in view, we request the Stock Exchanges to extend the time limit for consideration and approval of Unaudited Financial Results (both stand alone and consolidated) for the quarter ended on 30.6.2022 by the Board of Directors of MMTC Ltd by the end of August 2022  and subsequent announcement of Annual Audited Results thereafter.",

It may also be mentioned that due to sudden demise of the senior partner of our Statutory Auditors - M/s M L Puri & Co., the audit got delayed. Considering the number of joint venture companies in India and one wholly owned subsidiary in overseas (Singapore), consolidation of Annual Audited Accounts becomes very difficult to be completed within the time limit. NINL, a JV of MMTC is yet to finalise its annual accounts due to Corona/labour issues. All efforts are being made to get the accounts of NINL finalized soon. we request the Stock Exchanges to extend the time limit for consideration and approval of Unaudited Financial Results (both stand alone and consolidated) for the quarter ended on 30th June 2021 by the Board of Directors of MMTC Ltd by 30th September 2021",
